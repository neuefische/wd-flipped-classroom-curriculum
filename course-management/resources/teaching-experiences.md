# Teaching Experiences

This file serves as a collection of experience reports, teaching a diverse group of students. Please document any tips you found helpful in order to ensure a comfortable learning atmosphere for every student.
Please make sure to never include any identifying information in this document.

## Quick feedback

Frequently asking the students for feedback in the form of a mood scale has proven to be very helpful, especially after tricky sessions. Knowing right away if some students feel at a loss can prevent more severe knowledge gaps later on.

## Neurodiversity

### ADD/ADHD

Students, who take medication for ADD/ADHD, may rely on a fixed time schedule. Be aware that this might require the need for fixed times for lunch breaks for example.

## Speech disorders

Be aware that not every student feels comfortable presenting their work publicly e.g. in a public sprint review. A chat with the student can help to brainstorm other solutions for accountability throughout the capstone phase.

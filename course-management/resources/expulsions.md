# Expulsions

### When does it become necessary to expel a student?

- the student does not join class without providing an absence note (truancy )
- the student behaves disrespectfully towards a coach or other students
- the student refuses to participate in exercises
- the student does not deliver any posed tasks and shows lack of motivation

> üí° Note from student services: the decision to expel a student can be made in self-defense (e.g. preservation of dignity, to counter racism or sexism, ...). In this case it is possible
> but not necessary to refer to the student services. This decision can be made according to the best of the
> knowledge of the coach(es).

### Procedure

The procedure of expulsion depends largely on how the student is financing the bootcamp. If the
student is taking part through the "Bildungsgutschein" there are more steps to fulfill. First, these
are the first steps for any procedure:

**1. Issue a warning to the student**

- This can best be done in a "1-on-1" or a "2-on-1" with only the student and the coach(es).
- Warn the student that their behavior could lead to expulsion
- if you need good vocabulary try "Kursziel verfehlen" or "gest√∂rte Lernatmosph√§re"
- ‚ùóÔ∏è _document the warning in Slack_, for example by informing the student service in the internal
  course channel

**2. Take a record of the last day the student participated in the course**

- especially in case the student doesn't show up in class without absent note

**3. Notify student service that the expulsion should be proceeded**

- the student service will notify the "Agentur f√ºr Arbeit" and coordinate the documents they need
- sometimes the student service will also have the "actual talk" with the student to expel them,
  although this depends on the circumstances. Discuss in the team how you want to proceed.

**4. Short report on the expulsion with date and reason**

- a template for this report can be found
  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9RqfFOAZnTA45yWP__hkCaO1jrbIYO-2Rp4WpkR24U/edit)
- try to provide screenshots to proof the reason to expel the student, for example of the slack
  documentation about the warning
- ‚ùóÔ∏è _this report should be written even if the student payed for the bootcamp themself or with the
  "Chancen e.g."_

**5. Documentation for "Agentur f√ºr Arbeit"**

- the student service will confirm with the "Agentur f√ºr Arbeit" which documents are needed.
- Usually a form named "Nichtantritts-/ Austrittsmeldung Berfuliche Weiterbildung" needs to be
  filled out.
- Additionally a statement with the documented history of events might be required.

**5. When in doubt ask for help!**

- Ask the student service or the coaches pool, everyone is there to assist you!

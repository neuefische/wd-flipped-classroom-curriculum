# Course management

### What does the course management imply?

The course management is an additional responsibility aside the normal workflow of a coach. It is a collection of organizational tasks and to-dos that appear in the course.

For the course management there are some to-dos that come up once per course. Then there are some repeating tasks that are repeated on a weekly or daily basis.

[A checklist of all common tasks can be found here](./tasks/README.md)

There are also tasks that require specific circumstances. These tasks include dealing with
the expulsion (Ausschulung) of a student or the teaching experience regarding students met with special circumstances.

The following is a selection of occasional tasks:

- [expulsion](./resources/expulsions.md)

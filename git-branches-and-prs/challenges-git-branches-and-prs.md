# Challenges: Git Branches and PRs

## Session Notebook Part 2

(difficulty: ðŸ”¥)

Continue working on your session notebook.

1. First, create a new branch called `notes/github-and-markdown`.
2. Switch to that branch and start working on the respective session note. Fill the session note with short hints and a collection of commands you find helpful.
3. Commit regularly after each step, and use **good commit messages**.
4. When you are satisfied with the session note, push the content of the branch to the remote repository (`git push -u origin notes/github-and-markdown`).
5. On GitHub, go to the remote repository. A yellow action box should appear, suggesting you create a pull request for the named branch. Go ahead and create the pull request.
6. Share the link to the pull request with your group so they can review your notes.
7. Merge the pull request or incorporate suggestions from your group mates.
8. Repeat this workflow with the other session notes you created over the last few days.

# Challenges: How to Capstone

## Code Review

We prepared a fresh repository with a feature branch for you. Your task is to review that code and find the bugs/issues. You can use the [common issues](./how-to-capstone.md#common-issues) collection as a guide. Good Luck!

1. Create a new repository from [this template](https://github.com/neuefische/web-code-review-template). Make sure to check the "Include all branches" box when creating it.
2. Create a new PR with `main` as the base and `stuff` as the compare branch.
3. Go into the `changed files` tab and start reviewing!
4. Post your review in the solutions thread.

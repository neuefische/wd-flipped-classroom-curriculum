## Inform: Session Guide

### Capstone Procedure

- [ ] Explain the general capstone workflow. This includes
  - sprint timeline
  - daily schedule
  - user story workflow with code review and quality assurance
  - sprint planning
  - how to use the discussions board
- [ ] You can use the [how to capstone](../../workshops/how-to-capstone/index.md) marp slides ([english version](../../workshops/how-to-capstone_EN/index.md)) by running `npm run start` from the root of the web-curriculum project.
- [ ] Alternatively, you can use the [excalidraw template](./assets/how-to-capstone.excalidraw) to visualize the journey of one user story through the project board.

### How to Code Review

- [ ] Highlight that giving code reviews has many benefits for the students:
  - they learn how to read code and understand code faster
  - they get in contact with new patterns and ways of how to write code
  - code reviews should encourage discussions about code
- [ ] Use the [practice repository template](https://github.com/neuefische/web-code-review-template). Choose to copy all existing branches when using the template.
- [ ] Inside the new repository, create a pull request for the branch "stuff".
- [ ] Show the students the user interface for pull requests and explain the most important elements:
  - conversation tab: a timeline of the discussion about this PR, also includes the commit history.
  - changed files tab: a place where all changes are displayed on a file by file basis.
  - commenting changes: show how to comment on one and multiple lines of code in the "changed files" tab.
  - review changes: show how to submit a review and explain the 3 different categories "approve", "comment" and "request changes".
- [ ] Explain that this PR has quite a lot of errors and bad practices. The challenge for this session is to find and comment on these. Highlight that they can find a list of bad practices in the [handout](./how-to-capstone.md#how-to-review-code) of this session.

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups of 3
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again in one hour (at 5pm) in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - keep an eye on Slack
  - go through the rooms and check how the students are doing

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- [ ] Ask the students how easy or difficult this workflow was for them
- [ ] If it was difficult you can calm them and say that we will do it so many times during the
      bootcamp that they will dream of the git workflow.
  > - [ ] Optional if you feel like they need a compact, visual overview: <br> Let the students
  >       repeat the whole workflow and write the keywords and commands in an excalidraw.

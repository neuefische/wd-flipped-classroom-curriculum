# How to Capstone

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the Capstone process
- Getting hints how to work efficiently in a group
- Learning how to give effective code reviews

## Requirements

- Agile Workflow and User Stories
- Capstone Grouping and Setup
- Capstone Prep

## Demo

You can use the [How to Capstone](../../workshops/how-to-capstone/index.md) marp slides ([english version](../../workshops/how-to-capstone_EN/index.md)) by running `npm run start` from the root of the `web-curriculum` project.
Alternatively, you can use the [excalidraw template](./assets/how-to-capstone.excalidraw) to visualize the journey of one user story through the project board.

## Session Guide

In this session, weâ€™ll cover the essential steps for successfully navigating the Capstone project. This includes understanding the Capstone workflow and mastering the art of code reviews. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of the Capstone process and be prepared to give constructive code reviews to improve both your own and your peersâ€™ code quality.

> Why do you think code reviews are important in a team project, and how can both giving and receiving code reviews help us improve our skills as developers?

### Capstone Procedure

- Explain the general Capstone workflow, including:
  - Sprint timeline
  - Daily schedule
  - User story workflow with code review and quality assurance
  - Sprint planning
  - How to use the discussions board

### How to Code Review

- Highlight that giving code reviews has many benefits for the students:
  - They learn how to read code and understand code faster.
  - They get in contact with new patterns and ways of how to write code.
  - Code reviews should encourage discussions about code.
- Clone the [practice repository](https://github.com/wd-bootcamp/web-code-review-challenge). It has everything set up to create a PR with lots of problems ðŸ˜ˆ.
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:wd-bootcamp/web-code-review-challenge.git
  ```
- In order to persist the git history but also to practice in a separate repository, the students need to create a new remote repository and connect it to the cloned one.
- Show [the steps](./challenges-how-to-capstone.md#code-review) necessary to achieve this. Make sure that the students push the `main` branch first to the new repository. Otherwise it will not be recognized as the default branch.
- After creating the PR in the new remote repository, show the students the user interface for pull requests and explain the most important elements:
  - **Conversation Tab:** A timeline of the discussion about this PR, also includes the commit history.
  - **Changed Files Tab:** A place where all changes are displayed on a file by file basis.
  - **Commenting Changes:** Show how to comment on one and multiple lines of code in the "Changed Files" tab.
  - **Review changes:** Show how to submit a review and explain the 3 different categories: "Approve", "Comment" and "Request Changes".
- Explain that this PR has quite a lot of errors and bad practices. The challenge for this session is to find and comment on these. Highlight that they can find a list of bad practices in the [handout](./how-to-capstone.md#how-to-review-code) of this session and the [Capstone Docs](https://web-capstone-docs.neuefische.de/guides/code-reviews).

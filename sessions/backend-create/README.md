# Backend Create

## Learning objectives

- Understanding CRUD and REST APIs
- Building a Create REST API route

---

We will pave the way toward implementing a method to create new jokes.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

Creating data is an essential part of CRUD operations.

### Question

How can we implement a feature that allows us to create new jokes and send them to the `jokes`
collection of our `jokes-database`?

---

### Required

- Backend API Routes
- Backend MongoDB
- Backend Read

---

### GET vs. POST and CRUD operations

- Remind the students that they've already built a `GET` API route as part of the _Backend Read_
  session.
- Inform them that the next step would be building a `POST` API route.
- Remind students of the different [CRUD operations using this overview](./assets/CRUD.md).
- _Briefly_ remind the students of what a REST API is:
  - REST is short for "Representational State Transfer",
  - it refers to architectural principles and constraints how to structure your API.

> ðŸ’¡ This is a very basic and incomplete explanation. If you're interested in learning more about
> what makes an API RESTful, you can read about it [here](https://restfulapi.net/).

### Prepare Backend Database

To start with the database, open MongoDB Atlas and if you not have done so in the Backend MongoDB or the Backend Read session, create

- a database called _jokes-database_ and
- a collection called _jokes_;
- [Copy the jokes data](assets/data.json) into your _jokes_ collection by pasting it into the _Insert Document_ window using the view `{}`.

### Building a `POST` API route

- Navigate to `pages/api/index.js`
- Implement the code below just under your `GET` request.
- Keep in mind that you don't need to include the comments, they're simply an additional guide.

```js
//pages/api/index.js

if (request.method === "POST") {
  try {
    const jokeData = request.body;
    await Joke.create(jokeData);

    response.status(201).json({ status: "Joke created" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    response.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

[Final stage of the code without comments](https://github.com/neuefische/web-exercises/blob/main/sessions/backend-create/demo-end/pages/api/jokes/index.js)

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Since this is the implementation of just the route, it isn't "doing anything" yet.
> Imagine building a tunnel that isn't currently connected to a road carrying traffic.

- Explain that the general concept is quite similar to our `GET` method
- Keep in mind that theoretically anyone could post a joke to your database at this point, since
  there's no authorization process and the route isn't secure. We're choosing to ignore this for
  now.

### Building a form

- Note that we need to build a form to enable our user to submit a joke.
- Create the file structure `components/JokeForm/index.js` and add a form like this:

```js
//components/JokeForm/index.js

export default function JokeForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor="joke-input">Enter a new joke</label>
      <input type="text" id="joke-input" name="joke" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

- Navigate to the `pages/index.js` and render your `JokeForm`:

```js
// pages/index.js
import JokeList from "../components/JokeList";
import JokeForm from "../components/JokeForm";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <JokeForm />
      <JokeList />
    </>
  );
}
```

- Remind the students that, at this point, the form isn't quite functional yet.

### Connecting the `JokeForm` to your `POST` API route

- Explain that we plan to mutate the jokes state we receive in the JokeList component.
- Quickly remind the students about what mutating a state means:
  - We are changing the content of a state, e.g. adding an item to a list.
  - Each element in our app that uses this state needs to be updated to reflect this change.
- therefore we need to perform two actions:
  1. Sending a request to a specific endpoint for creating a new entry
  2. Revalidating the data from this specific endpoint in any place of the app where the endpoint is used
- We are going to use `fetch` for sending the POST request to the endpoint and `mutate` from the useSWR hook for revalidation
- Write the handleSubmit function for our form as follows:

```js
export default function JokeForm() {
  const { mutate } = useSWR("/api/jokes");

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const jokeData = Object.fromEntries(formData);

    const response = await fetch("/api/jokes", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(jokeData),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      mutate();
    }
  }

  return; //...
}
```

- Explain that the `useSWR` provides us next to `data`,`isLoading` and `error` with a method called `mutate`.
- If `mutate` is called, swr refetches the data for the respective endpoint and triggers a rerender of all components which use this endpoint.
- explain what the options mean, that we provide for the `fetch` call:
  - method: defines what kind of fetch we will perform
  - headers - "Content-Type": informs the server about what kind of data we will send
  - body: the data we send to the server transformed into a string.
- Highlight, that our jokeData now is send to our API and then is passed to mongoose which adds the joke to our database.
- If this fetch was successful, we call `mutate` and trigger the revalidation of the jokes array.
- Show that you can now submit jokes via your `JokeForm` and that the `JokeList` gets updated automatically.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: In the following _Backend Update and Delete_ session, we're going to reuse the `JokeForm` to update a database entry.

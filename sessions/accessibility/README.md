## Inform: Sessionguide

### Why should I care about accessibility?

- [ ] Eplain web accessibility (short [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym)): websites, tools and technologies are designed and developed that people with disabilities can use them

- [ ] Explain what disabilities that affect interaction/access: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual

- [ ] Show how that benefits **all** people: different screen sizes, changing abilities due to aging, temporary disabilities, situational limitations, slow Internet connection

- [ ] Show [this chart from Microsoft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5230863/180420356-992fb11b-8834-47b6-92a6-90ba59dbf93d.png) to explain how disablities can be very situational.  
(Full pdf [here](https://www.microsoft.com/design) -> scroll down -> Inclusive 101)

- [ ] Explain that a11y is required by law in many situations (e.g. for [public sector bodies in the EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&from=de))

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

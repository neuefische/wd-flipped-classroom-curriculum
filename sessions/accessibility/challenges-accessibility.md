## Active Learning

Welcome to this active learning session focused on exploring Accessibility in a self-directed way. As a developer, one of the most valuable skills is the ability to teach yourself effectively, so let's take some more steps in that direction.

## Quiz App project continuation

(difficulty: 🔥🔥)

Continue to work on your Quiz App project and make your application more accessible. Here are some
ideas of what you can do.

Make sure:

- you used semantic HTML whenever possible.
- all of your interactive elements have an accessible name. If there is an icon for example that the
  user can click, it might not have an accessible name yet.
- your pages have one h1 element and do not skip heading levels.
- the text content of your interactive elements is descriptive.

# Challenges: Accessibility

## Active Learning

Welcome to this active learning session focused on exploring Accessibility in a self-directed way. As a developer, one of the most valuable skills is the ability to teach yourself effectively, so let's take some more steps in that direction.

> The active learning process involves the following steps:

1. Read and Understand the Document: Begin by carefully reading the document and familiarizing yourself with its contents.

1. Analyze the Examples: As you progress through the document, take your time to break down and comprehend the various examples provided. They appear as you keep scrolling down the page.

## Quiz App Project Continuation

(difficulty: 🔥🔥)

Continue working on your Quiz App project and enhance its accessibility. Below are some ideas to guide your progress:

- Ensure that semantic HTML is used wherever possible.
- Verify that all interactive elements have an accessible name. For instance, an icon that the user can click might still lack an accessible name.
- Make sure each page includes a single `<h1>` element, and that heading levels are not skipped.
- Check that the text content of your interactive elements is clear and descriptive.

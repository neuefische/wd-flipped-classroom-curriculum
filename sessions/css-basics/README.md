## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for the topic

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

How can we style our HTML elements as efficiently as possible.

### Why is the content of todays block so important for the students?

We often need to change the look of our HTML elements to make them fit to a design. And we want to
be able to apply these stylings to different elements to have a common look and to avoid repetitive
code.

### Raise a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can I make it that the same stylings apply to multiple elements?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

We should not assume that students already have prior knowledge for CSS. But you can go into it
knowing that we've already learned how to structure our web page with HTML and will now understand
how to style those elements.

### Which prior knowledge will be used for this session?

- HTML Basics

## Inform: Session guide

**Notes:**

[One challenge](./css-basics.md/#personal-website-part-3) is to apply the stylings to the personal
website. Therefore, it should be considered that the students have already created a basic HTML
structure for their project.

### What is CSS?

Explain what CSS is based on an example.
[See CSS Basics Codesandboxes as example.](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/all/CSS%20Basics?workspace=2ad16d97-42cf-49d7-aa8d-e3587729c609)

- [ ] **Definition**: CSS means Cascading Stylesheets. While HTML defines the structure and
      semantics of your content, we use CSS for design and layout.

- [ ] **Purpose**:Â CSS is a declarative language that controls how web pages look in the browser.
      The basic goal of CSS is to provide elements of the page with certain features like colors,
      positioning or decorations.

- [ ] **Meaning** of the **terms** `Cascading` and `Stylesheets`:
  - `Cascading`: Cascading refers to the cascade, an algorithm that defines the order in which
    stylings are applied to elements. It is often the case that there are several competing stylings
    for an element. The cascade solves this problem. **Note:** The students will learn more about
    the cascade in following sessions.
  - `Stylesheet`: A style sheet consists of several of stylings that we declare with CSS and that
    determine the layout of the web page.

### Fundamentals

#### Syntax

Explain the syntax of a CSS rule/ruleset. You don't need to declare each part in deep, but you
shoudl cover the following terms:

- [ ] **Selector**: A CSS selector is used to specify the elements to which CSS rules apply.
- [ ] **Property**: Name for a particular property to which a value is attributed.
- [ ] **Value**: The value we assign to a property.
- [ ] **Declaration**:Each pair of property and value is a declaration.

It may help to explain the syntax with a scribble in Excalidraw:

#### Basic selectors

- [ ] Show and explain the most basic selectors based on the example with which you started the
      session:

  - [ ] `universal` selector (may be introduced later when explaining the `box model` and
        `box-sizing`):

    - Selects all elements.
    - Syntax: `*`

  - [ ] `element` or `type` selector:

    - Selects all elements of a specific type.
    - Syntax: `elementname` like `article`, `section` or `body`

  - [ ] `class` selector:

    - Selects all elements that have the given class attribute.
    - Syntax: `.classname` for example `.button`, `.highlighted` or `.list`

- [ ] Show useful `CSS properties` that the students may need later for the challenges. Suitable
      examples could be:

  - `background-color`
  - `color`
  - `border`
  - `border-radius`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-align`

#### Box model & `box-sizing`

To make good layouts with CSS and to understand how the styling with CSS works, the students should
learn to understand the **box model** and why the `property` `box-sizing` is very helpful.

- [ ] **Box model**: Every element is a rectangular box. This means that everything has a box around
      it. Every box consists of four parts. Explain via a scribble in Excalidraw:

![box model](assets/box-model.png)

- [ ] Explain the following terms:

  - `Content`: The actual content of the element.
  - `Padding`: Space between the content and the border of the element.
  - `Border`: The border of the element.
  - `Margin`: The space around the border and other elements. An empty/ outermost area around the
    border area, separates the element from its neighbors.

- [ ] Explain how we can change from `content-box` to `border-box` with the `box-sizing` property:

  - Questions you should answer: How is the size of this box calculated? And why do we use
    `box-sizing: border-box`?
  - **Benefit:** Calculating sizes of elements is easier and more intuitive with `border-box`
  - With the `property` `box-sizing` we determine how the total width and height of an element is
    calculated.
  - Show an example where you can visualize the difference `box-sizing: border-box` makes in
    comparison to `box-sizing: content-box`.
    [See **CSS Basics: Box-sizing** Codesandboxes as example.](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/all/CSS%20Basics?workspace=2ad16d97-42cf-49d7-aa8d-e3587729c609)

### Inline & block elements & `display`

- [ ] Show the differences between inline and block elements (based on your starter Codesandbox):
  - As every element on a web page is a rectangular box how much space do they take by default? It
    depends on whether the elements are inline or block elements.
  - [ ] **Block elements**:
    - The width of a block element depends on the available space within its parent element.
    - By default, the block element always takes the full width unless you have changed the value
      yourself with CSS.
    - Each new block element also creates another paragraph: subsequent elements slide under the
      block element.
    - Common block elements: `<header></header>`, `<footer></footer>`, `<article></article>`
      `<aside></aside>`, `<section></section>`, `<p></p>` `<nav></nav>`, the headings from `h1` to
      `h6`, `<ul></ul>`, `<ol></ol>` and `<li></li>`.
  - [ ] **Inline elements**:
    - Wrapping parts of a text in inline elements does not break the flow of the text.
    - An inline element will apply margin and padding, but break to the next line.
    - Margin and padding will push elements only horizontally and not vertically.
    - An inline element will apply declaration with `width` and `height`.
    - Common inline elements: `<em></em>`, `<strong></strong>` and `<span></span>`.
  - [ ] **Optional: Inline-Block**:
    - Inline block elements are a combination of inline and block boxes.
    - They flow like inline elements on one line, but create spacing to the top and bottom lines
      like a block element and respond to the height and width specifications in the CSS code.

### Styling fonts & working with relative units

- [ ] Explain to students what properties they can use to change and style fonts, making reference
      to relative units. So use font styling to make students aware that px should be avoided as a
      unit in certain cases.

  - [ ] **Generic fonts**:

    - CSS defines five generic names for fonts: `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, and
      `fantasy`
    - The fonts face of these fonts can vary between each browser.

  - [ ] **Useful properties**:
    - `font-family`
    - `font-weight`
    - `font-size`
  - [ ] **Relative and absolute units**:

    - **Absolute units**: Units that are not relative to anything else. For example `px`.
    - **Relative units**: Are relative to something else.

      - `em`: Relative to the font size set on the parent element of the current element.
      - `rem`: Relative to the font size set on the root element of the document.
      - `vw`: Relative to the viewport width
      - `vh`: Relative to the viewport height

  - [ ] Explain that we recommend to use **relative units for font sizes** and not absolute units
        for accessibility reasons.
        [See this article for further information and examples](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/).

### How to link stylesheets

- [ ] Explain what a stylesheet is and create a separate CSS stylesheet

  - Show students how to link the stylesheet to their HTML file
  - **Optional:** Show [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and how to import a Google font:
    - There are three possibilities:
      - use `@import` in your css file
      - use `link` element in the html file
      - download the font and add it to the project by using `@font-face`

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](css-basics.md) for the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students in groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules (Meet again 30min before lunchbreak in the classroom / They
      can ask the coaches for help at any time / Always help each other / Take a break when you need
      it in the next 1.5h/ Keep an eye on Slack)

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of MVP / Solution

- Come back to the question that was raised in the beginning of the session and try and answer it in
  a few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress of the day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

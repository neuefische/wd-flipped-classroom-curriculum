## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for the topic

> ğŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

How can we style our HTML elements as efficiently as possible.

### Why is the content of todays block so important for the students?

We often need to change the look of our HTML elements to make them fit to a design. And we want to
be able to apply these stylings to different elements to have a common look and to avoid repetitive
code.

### Raise a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can I make it that the same stylings apply to multiple elements?

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](css-basics.md) for the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students in groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules (Meet again 30min before lunchbreak in the classroom / They
      can ask the coaches for help at any time / Always help each other / Take a break when you need
      it in the next 1.5h/ Keep an eye on Slack)

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of MVP / Solution

- Come back to the question that was raised in the beginning of the session and try and answer it in
  a few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ğŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress of the day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

# Git Branches & PRs

> ðŸ’¡ feel free to create a personal branch of this guide to add your own notes

## Learning objectives

- [ ] why the following concepts are important for collaboration.
- [ ] what git branches are and how to use them.
- [ ] what Pull Requests are and how to use them.

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for the topic

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- Working on the main branch is dangerous, since you might introduce a bug into the production
  version of your application
- A save workflow is needed where features can be developed and tested without breaking the main
  version of the application
- This workflow is git feature branches

### Why is the content of todays block so important for the students?

- using git branches full potential is mandatory if you want to work in the industry

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which prior knowledge will be used for this session?

- [ ] git commits
- [ ] git repositories
- [ ] pushing to main branch

- [ ] show how to create a new branch

  - [ ] `git branch <branch name>` / `git switch -c <branch name>`
  - [ ] `git checkout <branch name>` / `git switch <branch name>`

- [ ] create some commits on the feature branch
- [ ] show how you can now switch between different versions of the code by switching branches

      save environment

## Process: Project / Assignment

- [ ] Provide the [handout](git-branches-and-prs.md) for the students

- [ ] Divide the students in groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules (Meet again 30min before lunchbreak in the classroom / They
      can ask the coaches for help at any time / Always help each other / Take a break when you need
      it in the next 1.5h/ Keep an eye on Slack)

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress of the day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

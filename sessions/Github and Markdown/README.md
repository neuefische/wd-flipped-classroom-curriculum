## Learning objectives

- What is a VCS and why is it so useful / important
- Importance of GitHub in dev community
- Understanding what Markdown is / what it is used for / how to write Markdown

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- How to manage source code in a team. Importance of VCS:
  - How would you share code among team members without a VCS?
  - How would you "go back" to previous code versions (and serve previous software versions) when there is a bug in production?
  - TBD: Tell story about a software project gone terribly wrong because of the lack of a VCS

### Why is the content of todays block so important for the students?

- You are starting your professional developer career today. After today you will have your own presence & presentation on one of the the worlds biggest platforms for code sharing.

## Activate prior knowledge of students

- Ask questions:
  - Have you come into contact with a VCS before (and how / why)?
  - Can you think of anything where a VCS would have been helpful to you (e.g. writing an assay and accidently deleting parts of it)?

  - `version control`
  - `repository` : Collection of files with historisation / different versions.
  - `commit` (+ `hash` as unique identifier)

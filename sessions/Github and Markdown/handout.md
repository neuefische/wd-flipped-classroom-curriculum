# GitHub and Markdown

## Markdown

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax. It makes writing formatted text (bold headlines, Blockquotes, lists, etc.) easier.
You don't have to learn HTML or some other more demanding language. Just write your Markdown in plain text and see your beautifully formatted results.
You can view the formatted result of your Markdown in your Code Editor. It is also used by countless Websites likes GitHub.

### Markdown Examples

## Git & Commits

Git is an open source version control system. It is a tremendous help in managing source code. It:

- keeps track of all changes made to the source code
- enables developers to easily collaborate on the same project and exchange updates (new files, newer versions of files)
- enables developers to "go back" to earlier versions of the source code

### Git Repositories

A Git repository is a place where a project is being saved. It keeps track of all versions of the project files. Many people can have access to (and work on) the same repository.

### Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Creating a commit in your project is similar to hitting the "save" button in a video game. The process you have made so far will not be lost and you can always `go back` to the commit - so you will have all the project files as they were when you made the commit.
Each commit contains a message which should include a descriptive text, so that you and other developers will know what changes the commit includes.

### Good commit messages

Writing good commit message is an artform in itself. It is good to stick to the following rules:

- Your commit message should be short and descriptive.
- Write your commit message in the imperative (present tense): "Add shop page" instead of "Added shop page".
- Do not end your commit message with a period.

All commit messages combined should form a protocol or log of all features and changes made to the code base. Other developers should be able to understand what happened at each step of the development process only by reading the commit messages.

## GitHub

Now we know about git, but what exactly is GitHub? In its core, GitHub is an online platform where you can store, share and collaborate on `remote git repositories`. With GitHub, the same codebase can be shared and edited across many collaborators. Many repositories are open source, so you can create a copy of the code, modify it or use it in your own projects. Nearly `every open source project` has a repository on GitHub.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Check out this huge [list of GitHub repositories](https://github.com/pawelborkar/awesome-repos) and see what you can find there.

At the same time GitHub is a social network for developers and companies of all kind. Your GitHub profile will be a valueable public asset for your future career. You can get in contact with many open source projects, developers and even companies via GitHub.

> ðŸ’¡ Even though GitHub is the most popular online git platform, it is by far not the only one. There are several alternatives to GitHub, i.e Gitlab or Bitbucket.

## Project: GitHub Profile

We are going to... At the end of this project you will have a GitHub profile for everyone (future employers included) to see...

### Part 1

- Create a GitHub account with professional username
- Create a new repository **with the same name as your GitHub username**
- Create an empty README.md file and commit (focus on writing `good commit messages`)

### Part 2

Start to fill your profile README. Make sure to have at least:

- a headline of your liking
- an interesting text / description about yourself or your profile
- a link to a picture

Commit after each step with a `good commit messages`

### Part 3

### Optional

Do some of the interactive

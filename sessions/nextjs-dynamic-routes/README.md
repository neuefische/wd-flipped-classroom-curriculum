## Session Guide

Static routes are suitable for some use cases. However, when the route needs to be flexible and requires dynamic query parameters, we use dynamic routes.

> How can you conceptually avoid redundancy in repeated pages (like movies or volumes) and make the paths more dynamic so that you don't have to create one file per path?

### Dynamic Routes vs. "Static Routes"

- Remind the students of how the app in the starter code works.
- Show that even though we have a lot of movies in our data, we currently only show one film: Aquaman. It would be quite some work to create pages for every single movie in our data array.
- Explain that we can use a concept called dynamic routes.
- Dynamic routes allow us to create a single page JavaScript file that is used for a dynamic placeholder segment in our URL.
- Explain that in the URL `movies/aquaman`, `aquaman` is one value of the dynamic placeholder segment.
- Explain that the placeholder is expressed with square brackets:
  - `pages/movies/[slug].js` (â†’ `movies/foo`, `movies/bar`, `movies/baz`, â€¦) is a dynamic route.
  - `pages/movies/aquaman.js` (â†’ `movies/aquaman`) is a static route.
- Here `[slug]` is the placeholder for the dynamic segment of the URL, just like a variable, we can give it any name we want.
- Explain that we can access the value of the dynamic segment using the `useRouter` hook provided by Next.js.

### Creating a Dynamic Route

- Rename `pages/movies/aquaman.js` to `pages/movies/[slug].js`.
- Show that you can now open `/movies/aquaman` and `/movies/the-avengers` and see the same page.
- Explain that we want to show the correct movie depending on the slug.
- Point out that the `"aquaman"` slug is hardcoded in the `Movie` component.
- Import `useRouter` from `next/router` and use it to get the slug from the URL:
  ```js
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  ```
- Explain that `router.query` is an object that contains all the query parameters of the URL. We use destructuring to get the `slug` property.
- Explain that `slug` is named `slug` because the file is named `[slug].js`. If we were to name it `[banana].js` we would have to destructure `banana` from the `query` object.
- Replace the hardcoded `"aquaman"` with `slug` in the `Movie` component and show that the correct movie is now shown.

### Generating Links to Dynamic Routes

- Show that we still link to the static route `/movies/aquaman` in the `Movies` component.
- Explain that we need to map over the movies and generate a link for each movie.
- Import the movies into the `Movies` component:

  ```js
  import { movies } from "../../lib/data";
  ```

- Explain that we use the `map` method to generate a link for each movie while using string interpolation to create the correct URL:

  ```js
  {
    movies.map(({ slug, title, id }) => (
      <li key={id}>
        <Link href={`/movies/${slug}`}>{title}</Link>
      </li>
    ));
  }
  ```

- Show that all the links work now.

### Edge-Case: Use of useRouter with Next.js Pre-Rendering

- Why is this `early return` so important?

```js
if (!currentMovie) {
  return null;
}
```

- Comment it out and show that it doesn't make any difference - as long as you are using the `Next.js Link Components` inside of your app. (These links don't make real http-requests to the server).

- In opposite: If you create a real http-request by typing `movies/Aquaman` into the browsers URL it will throw an error: `currentMovie` is now undefined because when pre-rendering the site, the `slug` can't be read from the browsers API and a `currentMovie` can't be found.

### Imperative Routing

> ðŸ’¡ If you are short on time, skip this section. Imperative routing is explained in the handout and only required for the bonus challenge.

- Explain that we can also navigate imperatively using the `router.push` method. This is useful when we want to navigate to a route not in direct response to a user action.
- As an example we want to create a button that navigates to the aquaman movie page, but only after the user confirms that they are - in fact - Aquaman.
  - This is of course a silly example, but it illustrates the concept.
  - In the future this will mainly be used to navigate to a new page after a create form has been submitted.
- Add a button to the `Movies` component that asks the user if they are Aquaman.
  ```js
  <button onClick={() => {}} type="button">
    Are you Aquaman?
  </button>
  ```
- In the `onClick` handler we want to use the native `confirm` method to ask the user if they are Aquaman.
  ```js
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      if (confirm("Are you Aquaman?")) {
        console.log("navigate to the aquaman movie page");
      }
    }}
    type="button"
  >
    Are you Aquaman?
  </button>
  ```
- Demonstrate that the button shows a confirmation dialog and only logs a message if the user confirms.
- Explain that we need to use a method provided by Next.js to actually navigate to the aquaman page.
- Explain that we can use the `useRouter` hook to get the `router` object which has a `push` method that when called navigates to a new path. Import it and use it in the `Movies` component.

  ```js
  import { useRouter } from "next/router";
  ```

  ```js
  const router = useRouter();
  ```

  ```js
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      if (confirm("Are you Aquaman?")) {
        router.push("/movies/aquaman");
      }
    }}
    type="button"
  >
    Are you Aquaman?
  </button>
  ```

- Point out that a `<Link>` component should _always_ be preferred over imperative routing, because it is more accessible, it is easier to see where the link goes and Next.js also prefetches the page in the background giving us a faster page load.

### Head Component

- Explain that we can use the `Head` component to change the title of the page or add meta tags and other information to the head of the page.
- Import the `Head` component from `next/head` and use it in the `Movie` component to change the title of the page to the title of the movie.
  ```js
  import Head from "next/head";
  ```
  ```js
  <Head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </Head>
  ```
- Show that the title of the page is now the title of the movie.

- Repeat the same thing for the `Movies` component but set the title to `List of Movies`.
  ```js
  <Head>
    <title>List of Movies</title>
  </Head>
  ```

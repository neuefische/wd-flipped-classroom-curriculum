# Challenges: Capstone Prep

## User Stories

(difficulty: üî•üî•)

Start (or continue) working on your user stories. Make sure that toward the end of the "Capstone Prep" you've finished up your user stories to a satisfactory degree. Perhaps there's something you've missed or something that needs to be clarified?

Here's a quick checklist to check against:

**Content**

- [ ] a clean & concise wireframe
- [ ] developer tasks

**Syntax**

- [ ] well-formatted (no broken lists, links, etc)
- [ ] grammar & spelling

Here's a few subjects that, as a group, you may still want to think about:

**Estimations**

- Are there any dependencies?
  - What needs to be completed when?
  - Are there requirements for external libraries?
- Are there any priorities that need to be discussed?
  - "We need to figure out XYZ before we start with ZYX."/etc
- Review & Refine
  - Do we need to come back to some of our user stories now that we've finished them all?

## Group Rules

(difficulty: üî•)

1. Introduction & Objective üìù

- Start with a brief introduction.
- Make sure everyone is aligned about the goal of the exercise.
- Establish what you're trying to achieve.
- Open up an empty document in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [Figma](https://figma.com/) or create a [Scrumlr](https://scrumlr.io/new) board for the purpose of note taking.
- Decide on a person responsible for taking notes.

2. Individual Presentation üó£Ô∏è

- Everyone has approximately five minutes to present their "Manual of Me".
- During the presentation, try to find similarities among the individual members of the group, such as a shared focus on "not wanting to be interrupted", or occasionally needing "alone time", etc.
- The person taking notes is encouraged to write down their findings, but everyone individually should make sure to take notes of their own as well.

3. Brainstorming & Drafting Norms üö¶

- Share your notes and try to translate them into rules that will sustain optimal group dynamics.
- Try to stick to a "Yes, and ..." instead of a "No, because ..." approach.
- Respect and protect each other's boundaries. Everybody is different.
- Draft a set of team norms that addresses
  - communication (_how do we communicate ..._)
  - the day to day (_when do we meet, how do we work, ..._)
  - conflict resolution (_how do we recover from disagreements ..._)
  - work distribution (_how can we make sure that everyone can do their best_)
  - feedback (_what should our feedback culture look like ..._)

4. Consensus & Commitment ü§ù

- Make sure everyone can come to an agreement regarding the rules.
- Acknowledge the fact that these rules should be respected and adhered to.

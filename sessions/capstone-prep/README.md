## Session Guide

The purpose of this preparation slot is for the students to be able to "hit the ground running" once the first Capstone Sprint comes around. The students should be encouraged to get their ducks in a row so they need not find their bearings and rush into things unprepared on Day 1.

### Learning Objectives

- [ ] Start working on and/or finish up user stories
  - [ ] create wireframes
  - [ ] write developer tasks
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] define group rules based on their "Manual of Me"
- [ ] Study the [Capstone Docs](https://web-capstone-docs.neuefische.de/)
- [ ] Optional: Complete various other preparation activities

### Introduction

#### User Stories

> ðŸ’¡ At the beginning of the Capstone Prep, students should first review all of the prepared user stories together to ensure that everyone understands them and is on the same page. Subsequently, they should create wireframes and tasks for each user story.
>
> It may be beneficial to investigate where the students are at in terms of their user stories. They may have potentially gotten around to getting started yet. If there's groups trailing behind, it may be necessary to evaluate what's halting their progress.
>
> You may want to inquire whether
>
> - they have already started,
> - they have concerns or issues with the process overall,
> - they're unsure how to proceed, or
> - they don't feel confident starting with/finishing up their user stories for some other reason.

- If the students haven't already started working on their user stories, encourage them to do so in a manner that best suits them (perhaps they need to read them individually first then work through them as a team).
- Explain that it's perfectly fine to struggle a little in the beginning.
- If there's time, take a moment to very briefly summarize (< 1 min.) the benefits of writing good user stories and the challenges presented by bad user stories.

#### Wireframes

- Briefly remind the students that wireframes need not be overly polished.
- Explain that, as the name already reveals, a wireframe is about as detailed as if they were trying to shape their website out of copper wire.
- Make sure they understand that a proper design document isn't strictly necessary for their Capstone Project to be a success.

#### Group Rules

- Emphasize that, for a healthy group dynamic, establishing rules up front is highly beneficial.
- Encourage them to find their own way how to share the results of their "Manual of Me" amongst the groups and write their own set of rules based on their findings.
- Remind them to acknowledge that their "Manual of Me" is a manual for others, to be shared with the group.
- If they struggle to organize sharing their "Manual of Me" and deciding on their group rules, they are welcome to follow the guidelines established in the [handout](./capstone-prep.md).

#### Optional: Other Activities

In case any group has already finished their preparations, you may suggest the following tasks for them to consider:

**Tech Stack Review**

- What does their tech stack consist of?

**Version Control Workflow**

- Have they established a `git` workflow?
- Does everyone understand their chosen workflow?

**Coding Standards and Best Practices**

- Do they want to manifest a handful of simple best practice agreements?

**Team Building Time**

- Do they want to set aside an hour each week for team building measures?

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](./capstone-prep.md) and the [challenges](./challenges-capstone-prep.md) to the students
- [ ] (Briefly) walk them through the challenges
- [ ] Divide the students into their existing Capstone groups

## Session Guide

To build dynamic React applications that interact with external systems, such as APIs, it is crucial to understand how to perform data fetching. In this session, we will explore how to connect our React apps to APIs and load data using `fetch`.

> Why is `fetch` considered a side effect, and how can you use it effectively in React?

### Introducing the Bad Jokes API

- Open the following API URL in the browser.
- Mention that this an example API that returns bad jokes.
- Explain this API returns one joke at a time, based on the `id` given at the end of the URL.
- Change the `id` to demonstrate the API returns a different joke (id: 0, 1, 2, ... 14).

```
https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/bad-jokes/0
```

- Explain that we like to write a React app that does exactly this: load and display different jokes.

### Effects in React

- Explain that we already learned how to load data from an API in JavaScript: `fetch`.
- Point out that the data fetching itself works the same in React as in vanilla JS.
- Highlight that we need to call `fetch` in React in a special way because it's a `side effect` - because it connects our app with an external system outside of React.
- Point out that React components are required to be `pure functions`.
  - A React component receives data (state or props) and returns JSX.
  - It always returns the same result with the same input.
  - Like in math: `2 + 3` always equals `5`.
- Explain that pure functions - per definition - `cannot have side effects`.
  - Connecting to a server that might not be reachable or returns changed data is `not pure`.
  - The result would differ based on an external system outside of the component.
  - Therefore, it is a side effect.
- Explain a side effect can't happen during rendering of a component (the executed code on the top level of your component).
  - It would lead to unexpected behavior: like executing the side effect to often (with every render) or causing to many state updates, even infinite rendering loops.
- Explain that React offers some `"escape hatches"`. They allow you to `"step outside"` of React and connect to an external system.
  - Explain that the `useEffect` hook is one of them.
  - Explain that `useEffect` lets you write an effect (a function) that runs some code after React has rendered a component on the screen.
  - Highlight that we can control precisely when this effect should run again.
  - Point out we can use `useEffect` to call `fetch`.

### Fetching a Joke

- Open the `Joke` component.
- Create a state to store the result of the fetch (don't forget to import `useState`):

```jsx
const [joke, setJoke] = useState();
```

- Explain we are going to use `fetch` as we have used it before.
- Point out there is nothing special about using fetch in React.
- Mention we don't care about error handling right now to keep the example simple.
- Write an `async` function `startFetching` with the `fetch` logic inside.
- Update the state using `setJoke` with the data.
- Call `startFetching`:

```jsx
async function startFetching() {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/bad-jokes/0"
  );
  const joke = await response.json();

  setJoke(joke);
}
startFetching();
```

- Explain that this is a side effect. To handle this side effect, we need to use the `useEffect` hook.
- Point out we need `useEffect` to control when this effect should run. Without `useEffect` it would fetch data again with every re-render of the component.
- Wrap the `useEffect` hook around the code before **without** using a dependency array (don't forget to import `useEffect`).
- Explain that the first argument of `useEffect` is a callback function. We can write the side effect in this function.
- Point out the idea is to simply wrap the `useEffect` hook around our side effect.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function startFetching() {
    // ...
  }
  startFetching();
});
```

- Mention that loading data via the network takes some time. We don't want the component to render anything when the data is not loaded yet.
  - Add the following code **below** the `useEffect`:

```jsx
if (!joke) {
  return null;
}
```

- Replace the static text in the headline with a value from the state.

```jsx
<h1>{joke.joke}</h1>
```

- Open the browser and demonstrate that the joke is displayed.

### Dependency Array

- Open the dev tools network panel and demonstrate that the browser is constantly loading data (maybe close the tab to not kill the browser).
- Highlight that we forgot a very important step: We need to control when the effect should be executed.
- Explain that `useEffect` accepts a dependency array for this purpose.
- Point out, that a dependency array should always be defined. Without a dependency array the effect runs every time `any` state in the component changes.
- Explain that this is what happens right now:
  - React displays the component on the screen for the first time.
  - This initial render will always trigger the effect to run.
  - The data is fetched.
  - We update the state by calling `setJoke`.
  - This will trigger a re-render.
  - After the re-render the effect is executed again because a state changed.
  - The effect will load data and update the state again.
  - This will trigger a re-render and the effect execution again.
  - And so on ... it's an endless loop.
- Point out that we can and should always control when a effect is executed by using the dependency array.
- Explain an `empty dependency array` tells React to run this effect only once: when the component appears on the screen for the first time.
- Add an empty dependency array to the effect:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, []);
```

- Open the browser and show that the joke is displayed.
- Open the dev tools panel and demonstrate we don't fetch endlessly anymore.

> ðŸ’¡ You might want to mention that we see the request two times. This is due to React StrictMode, which renders the app twice.

### Fetching Different Jokes

- Explain we can use the dependency array to control that the effect should be executed when specific data changes: like state or props.
- Mention this is what we want to do next.
- Show the `button` in the JSX and point out there is no event attached yet. We want to use this button to change the displayed joke.
- Create a new state for the `id` of the joke with `0` as initial value.

```jsx
const [id, setId] = useState(0);
```

- Change the URL for `fetch`: use a template literal and interpolate the `id` at the end

```jsx
const response = await fetch(
  `https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/bad-jokes/${id}`
);
```

- Explain now we want the effect to run when the `id` changes.
- Add the `id` as dependency to the effect:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [id]);
```

- Add an `onClick` event listener to the `button`.
  > ðŸ’¡ The API returns a `nextId` property that you can use to set the next id.

```jsx
<button type="button" onClick={() => setId(joke.nextId)}>
  Next Joke
</button>
```

- Open the browser and demonstrate that clicking on the button will change the joke.
- Open the dev tools panel and demonstrate there is a network request when we click on the button.

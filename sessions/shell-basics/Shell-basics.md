## Shell

Normally, you use your operating system via a graphical user interface (GUI), i.e. the finder in Mac, windows explorer in Windows or basically anything you see on screen when using your computer.

As developers we need to learn an additional way to interact with our computer, the so called shell, to access crucial tools and features. Instead of an graphical user interface, the shell is text based. This means, that anyting you want to do has to be executed via specific commands written in a command line. Inside the shell you can do everything and even more you can already do with the GUI of your operating system. Every functionality like displaying the files of the current directory, changing directories, creating new files, deleting files, opening any program on the computer has its own command.

The default shell installed on Mac is zsh (z shell). The program which displays the shell command line and output is the so called terminal. In Mac, the terminal programs are iterm or iterm2.

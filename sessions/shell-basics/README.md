# Shell Basics

> üí° feel free to create a personal branch of this guide to add your own notes

## Learning objectives

- [ ] Understanding what the terminal and the shell are and why they are used.
- [ ] Understanding the difference between the shell, the terminal and CLI.
- [ ] Navigating the file system inside the shell.
- [ ] Creating, renaming, removing and moving files and folders in the filesystem.

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> üí° Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- Many developer tools don't have a graphical User Interface, but are nevertheless incredibly
  useful. (e.g. git, npm, node)
- We want to learn how to interact with these tools through the CLI to get access to them and use
  them to write amazing code.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

- Being able to navigate in the Shell and interact with programs via CLI is an essential skill for
  every developer and required for any job in the field.
- It's the first step to feel like a hacker.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

- What is the shell / the terminal and why is it useful?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

It is an option to start the session with these questions and follow up with the motivation of the
students:

- e.g. you open the terminal, start sharing you screen and ask the students if they know/have ever
  used the terminal.
- This is to start with a little bit more interactivity, in case the students are still shy to
  speak.

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

You can ask these questions:

- Did any of you ever use the terminal before? Was it easy or difficult to use?
- Did any of you ever open the terminal by accident and ask themselves what the heck is this used
  for?

## Inform: Session Guide

### Terminal

**Explain what the terminal is and what it's used for:**

- [ ] `the terminal` is a command line interface (CLI) that allows us to interact with the operation
      system of our computer.
- [ ] It's used to run programs and perform actions. As a developer we use the terminal for a lot of
      tasks, like creating files, installing programs, start or stop a server and many more.
- [ ] It's the program to have access to `the shell` and interact with it.
- [ ] `the terminal` is the text based input/output environment. It accepts keystrokes as input and
      paints pixels on the screen as visual output.
- [ ] On macOS we can use the integrated program `Terminal`.

### Shell

**Explain what the shell is and what it's used for:**

- [ ] `the shell` is a program that runs in a terminal.
- [ ] It's used to actually execute the commands that we type and returns the results.
- [ ] Oftentimes the words shell and terminal are used interchangably, even though they are not
      exactly the same thing.

#### Basic shell commands

- [ ] `cd folder_name` / `cd ..` / `cd`: change directory
- [ ] `ls`: list files
- [ ] `pwd`: print working directory
- [ ] `mkdir folder_name`: create a directory
- [ ] `touch file.md`: create a file
- [ ] `rm file.md`: remove a file
- [ ] `mv`: move or rename a file
- [ ] `open .`: open the current folder in Finder
- [ ] `cat`: print the contents of a file to the terminal

### Why do develpers need to complicate everything and use the terminal instead of a graphical user interface (GUI)?

- [ ] The terminal also is a user interface, it just not graphical, meaning no pretty buttons or
      hamburger menus. It's a text based user interface.
- [ ] With a text based user interface you can **send/recieve information much faster**, because
      there is no additional (beautiful) layer that needs to process the information.
- [ ] It takes a lot of time to code a GUI, therefore **some programs don't use one**.
- [ ] Most of the people that ever get into the position to use a terminal, are technical and do
      have the skills needed to use it.
- [ ] You can **easily automate processes** in a shell, because you can write computer programs that
      execute the commands for you, this wouldn't be possible with a GUI.
- [ ] Different programs in the shell can be combined to interact with each other. (e.g. the output
      of one program can be passed as input to another program)

> **It's much faster, you can copy and paste the commands you need, and you will probably make less
> mistakes.**

But: With great power comes great responsibility! <br> You can do almost anything in the terminal,
also delete things irreversibily or other things that you didn't intend to so. So be cautious!

### Terminal Setup

- [ ] Provide the [handout](shell-basics.md) and [challenges](challenges-shell-basics.md) to the
      students

Guide the students through the Terminal Setup:

1. open the **spotlight search**: `cmd` `space`
2. open the terminal: `terminal`
3. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
4. (accept installing Xcode Command Line Tools, takes some minutes to install)
5. install [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#homebrew) via homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
   echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >>~/.zshrc
   ```
6. restart the terminal to enter the configuration or type
   ```bash
   p10k configure
   ```
7. configure the zsh theme as you like
8. change the font size of the terminal to 18px: `Terminal` -> `preferences` -> `Profiles` -> `Font`
   -> `Change...`

### VS Code installation

1. install VS Code and explain what in IDE is:
   ```bash
   brew install --cask visual-studio-code
   ```
1. install the prettier extension **Prettier - Code formatter** and explain what a code formatter
   does
1. Go the VS Code settings and:
   - search for "default formatter" and set to prettier
   - search for "format on save" and hit checkbox
1. install the extension `Auto Rename Tag`
1. install the extension `Live Preview`

### Challenges Preparations

- [ ] ‚ùóÔ∏è Create a `zip` file from the `treasure-hunt` directory and give it to the students
  - [ ] Make sure that everybody extracted the folder `treasure hunt` and changed into that folder
        with the terminal.

---

## Process: Project / Assignment

- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases: <br>
- **What is the shell / the terminal and why is it useful?**
  - The shell is a program that runs in our terminal.
  - It can access the services of the operating system of our computer (e.g. macOS). This means we
    can quickly execute any at action needed.
  - It let's us install, create, edit, download... really anything you can imagine.
  - Also, as soon as you start using it, people will think you are a real hacker.

## Checkout

> üí° In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

shell, terminal, CLI, cd, touch, ls

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

- [ ] Highlight the progress of the day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays.
> We use the keywords to automatically generate excalidraw tags with the help of [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator).
> The students structure the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are included in the structure.

# Challenges: Shell Basics

## Treasure Hunt

In this challenge you have to find the lost diamond of the ancient king of treasure island! Open the
**treasure-hunt.zip** that you received. Navigate through treasure island only with the terminal and
find the treasure! Use the following commands:

- use `cd` to change directories
- use `cd ..` to move out of the current folder
- use `ls` to look what is in the current folder
- use `cat` to see what is inside a markdown file
- use `pwd` to see your current directory path

Good luck!

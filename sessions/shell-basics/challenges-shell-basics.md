`touch` and `cd`):

```
notes
â”œâ”€â”€ released
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trash.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ announcement1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ announcement2.txt
â””â”€â”€ unreleased
    â”œâ”€â”€ announcement3.txt
    â””â”€â”€ private
        â”œâ”€â”€ notes1.txt
        â””â”€â”€ notes2.txt
```

Update the structure to the following (using `mv`, `rm` and `cd`):

```
notes
â”œâ”€â”€ private
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notes1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notes2.txt

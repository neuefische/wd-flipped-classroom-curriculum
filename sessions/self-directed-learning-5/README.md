# Self Directed Learning 5

This session is dedicated to self-directed learning. This means the students can decide freely which topics they want to recap and practice.

However some students find it helpful to have some guidance and suggestions on what to do. Therefore we provide **optional** challenges that the students can work on.

Take a look into the session handout and the challenges which suggestions are prepared for the students.

Feel free to link more resources within the cohort cloud message according to the needs of your students.
For example:

- Create a link to the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning) for questions that can be added by the students.
- Create a link to [the guides on how to ask good questions in our discussions board](https://github.com/neuefische/questions/wiki).
- Add a link to helpful video that you recommend.
- Add a link to an article that concludes a difficult topic of the week.

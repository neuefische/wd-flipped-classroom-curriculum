# Backend Update and Delete

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Understanding the Update and Delete part of CRUD operations
- [ ] Being able to implement `UPDATE` and `DELETE` API routes

---

## Update

To update an entry in your database, you need to do two things:

- define a `PUT` API route and
- connect the submit handler of an edit form to this API route.

### Update with Mongoose

First, define a `PUT` API route:

```js
// /api/jokes/[id].js
if (request.method === "PUT") {
  const jokeData = request.body;
  // Get the joke data from the request body
  await Joke.findByIdAndUpdate(id, jokeData);
  // Find the joke by its ID and update the joke using its ID and the new data.
  return response.status(200).json({ status: `Joke ${id} updated!` });
  // Return an OK status on successful update
}
```

### `PUT` using `fetch`

Second, tell the submit handler of your edit form

- to use the `PUT` API route (i.e. send a request to your database to edit an entry),
- wait for the database to respond and update the UI if necessary or
- navigate the user to a different page via `push()`.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: `PUT` and `PATCH` are semantically different. According to convention, we would use `PUT` to update our entire document, and `PATCH` to update individual fields. In our demo, we're using `PUT`, simply because we only ever have _one_ field to update.

Go to the `page` or `component` where you want to write the submit handler of your edit form. We need the `mutate` method to update the Joke component after a successful update.

```js
// /components/Joke/index.js
export default function Joke() {
  //...
  const { data, isLoading, mutate } = useSWR(`/api/jokes/${id}`);

  async function handleEdit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const jokeData = Object.fromEntries(formData);

    const response = await fetch(`/api/jokes/${id}`, {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(jokeData),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      mutate();
    }
  }
  return; //...
}
```

## Delete

To delete an entry in your database, you need to do two things:

- define a `DELETE` API route and
- connect a handler function which uses this API route.

### Delete with Mongoose

First, define a `DELETE` API route:

```js
if (request.method === "DELETE") {
  await Joke.findByIdAndDelete(id);
  // Find and delete the joke by its ID.
  response.status(200).json({ status: `Joke ${id} successfully deleted.` });
  // Confirm deletion with a status message.
}
```

### `DELETE` using `fetch`

We write a handler function which calls `fetch()` with the appropriate arguments and pass it to a delete button:

```jsx
// /components/Joke/index.js

  async function handleDelete() {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/jokes/${id}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
    });
    // Send a DELETE request to the server for a specific joke.
    if (response.ok) {
      // If the response is successful redirect to the home page
      router.push("/");
    }
  }

return (
  <button type="button" onClick={handleDelete}>
    Delete
  </button>
);
);
```

We don't want to use `mutate` with "DELETE" requests, since the deleted data cannot be refetched and a revalidation would result in an error.

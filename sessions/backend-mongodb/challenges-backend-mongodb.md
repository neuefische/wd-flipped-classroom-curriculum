# Challenges: Backend MongoDB

## Setting up a MongoDB Atlas account and database

Follow this guide to set up your MongoDB Atlas account and your first database.

1. Go to [the MongoDB Atlas homepage](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and choose "Try Free" to start the process.
2. Create an account by providing your data or sign up using Google.
3. You might need to verify your email address.
4. You might be asked to tell MongoDB Atlas something about your future use cases:

5. To create a cluster, choose
   1. `M0 Free`,
   2. `aws`, and
   3. `Frankfurt` and click on "Create".

6. In the left-hand navigation, choose `Security > Quickstart` to generate a first user. You might be led to this screen automatically after creating the cluster.
   1. Choose a username and a password.
   2. ðŸš¨ Make sure to write down your password!
   3. Click on "Create User".

   Your IP address might have been added automatically.

15. You should now see this screen:

<img src="assets/images/atlas_connect-to-cluster_finished-database-user.png" alt="Database user was generated" width="300px">

16. Click on "Choose a connection method". You will see a screen similar to the following:

<img src="assets/images/atlas_connect-to-cluster_connection-method-finished.png" alt="Connection to cluster finished" width="300px">

17. We will later need the connection string for our application. Click on "Copy" to copy it to your clipboard. It should look similar to this:

`mongodb+srv://coachingmongodb:<password>@cluster0.mu12zrz.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

18. Note the hint below: `Replace <password> with the password for the coachingmongodb user.`

    > This is the database user you have created before. Your database user might have a different name.

19. Store this connection string in a safe place, e.g. in a text file. You will need it later.

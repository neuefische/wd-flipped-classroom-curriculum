# Challenges: React with Local Storage

## Store stuff in your Browser

Open the developer tools of your browser and open the console.

Write any value to the `localStorage` and/or `sessionStorage`.

Reload the page, restart your browser (or heck, even restart your computer) and check if the value is still there.

# Challenges: Mock Interview 1

## Mock Interview Challenge: Two Sum

Given an `array` of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return `indices` of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Starter Code:

```js
const exampleNumbers = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const exampleTarget = 9;

const result = twoSums(exampleNumbers, exampleTarget); // Expected Output: [0,1]
console.log(result);

// Explanation: Because exampleNumbers[0] + exampleNumbers[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

function twoSums(numbers, target) {}
```

# Self Directed Learning Week 6

The Thursday afternoon is dedicated to self-directed learning. This means the students can decide freely which topics they want to recap and practice.

However some students find it helpful to have some guidance and suggestions on what to do. Therefore we provide **optional** challenges that the students can work on.

# Capstone Kickoff Workshop

## Capstone Project Idea Development

At the last four weeks of the bootcamp, you will be working in groups to develop an interactive Web App. The focus is on **applying and further deepening what you have learned** in the course together. To prepare you in the best possible way, we will start with a challenge for idea generation and initial planning of your projects.

The goal is to work out these ideas together. It is not about finding a new innovative project idea, but rather about finding an idea in which you can deepen and expand the knowledge you have learned so far - keep it simple. In general, you can orientate yourself on the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the functionalities.

# Example Project Idea: "Task Manager"

This is how your app ideas should look like. You can also include wireframes to sketch the structure of the App UI and to give a better impression how the app might look like.

## Description

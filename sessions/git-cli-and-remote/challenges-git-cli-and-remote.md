# Challenges: Git CLI and Remote

:exclamation: If you have done the the Mac Setup with zsh, Homebrew and VS Code already, you can skip the first two challenges and start with [Setting up git and GitHub](#setting-up-git-and-github).

## macOS Setup using zsh

> 💡 This will install and configure the software you'll be using during this bootcamp locally on your computer.

Carefully read and follow the
[instructions in the `web-setup` repository](https://github.com/neuefische/web-setup#readme).

Run the _General Setup_ script as described.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

> 💡 Following these steps you will install some basic extensions for Visual Studio Code and do some
> required setup for the course.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Open the Extensions Panel (<kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>X</kbd>)
3. Install the following extensions
   - [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
   - [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
   - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
   - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
4. Open the Visual Studio Code settings (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>)
   - Search for "Default Formatter" and set to "Prettier - Code formatter"
   - Search for "Format On Save" and check the checkbox
   - > 💡 This will set up Visual Studio Code to automatically format your code on save using
     > Prettier.
5. Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>.
   - Type "shell command" into the prompt.
   - Select _"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"_ and confirm the installation by
     pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - > 💡 This allows you to open a folder in Visual Studio Code from the command line with the
     > `code .` command.

## Setting up git and GitHub

💡 This will configure git on your machine and connect it to your GitHub account.

Carefully read and follow the
[instructions in the web-setup repository](https://github.com/neuefische/web-setup#-setting-up-git-and-github).

Run the _Setting up git and GitHub_ script as described.

## Session Notebook part 1

In this project you will create a markdown based notebook for all your upcoming session notes. In
this part you will create the folder structure and markdown files, in a future part we will fill up
these files with actual content.

> ❗️ You may only use the terminal for these tasks!

1. Create a folder called **session-notebook**.
2. Create a README.md in this folder, we will use it later to link to the other markdown files.
3. Inside this folder, create multiple folders, e.g. **shell-and-git**, **html**, **css**,
   **javascript**.
4. Create a markdown file for each session we had so far. Make sure they are created in the correct
   folder.
5. You could also create a **git-cheatsheet.md** file, where you collect all your git commands.

## Connect the Session Notebook to GitHub

You already created a folder and file structure for your session notes. Now we want to provide the
**session-notebook** to your GitHub account as a repository. Therefore we need to connect the local
repository with a remote repository.

### Part 1

The first step is to initialize a new repository based on the folder you created for the session
notes.

1. If not already done, navigate through the shell to the folder **session-notebook** you created
   for the session notes.
2. Make sure you have at least a **README.md** and optionally more folders and files. If not, create
   them by using shell commands.
3. Run the git command to initialize a new local git repository.
4. Create your first commit.

> 💡 After initializing you should get a message like this:
>
> ```
> Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/<your-username>/<path_to_folder>/session-notebook/.git/
> ```

### Part 2

For the next step you need to create a new repository on GitHub and connect your local repository
with the remote repository.

![Create a new GitHub repository](assets/create-new-repository.png)

1.  Open GitHub and create a new repository.
2.  Make sure it's a **public repository** and uncheck "Add a README file" because we already
    created one.
3.  You should see the heading "…or push an existing repository from the command line". Follow the
    instructions.

> 💡 Hint: if the name of your branch is already **main**, you don't need to use the command
> `git branch -M main` because this command renames the branch to main.

### Part 3

From now on you are able to push your local changes to the remote repository.

1. Create new files, add new content to them, remove content, etc.
2. **Commit** your changes. (Make multiple commits)
3. **Push** your changes to the remote repository and look at the GitHub repository page to see your
   changes.

> ❗️ Commit after each step with a good commit message.

> 💡 Hint: you can see the commit history on GitHub.

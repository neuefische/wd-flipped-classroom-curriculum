### Introduction

- [ ] Mention that we wrote CSS using the BEM approach in `.css` files until now
- [ ] Explain we are learning a very different new approach today: writing CSS-in-JS
  - [ ] We will generate the CSS styles with JavaScript
  - [ ] This gives us a lot of flexibility when applying styles to elements
  - [ ] We bring React components and their styles together and remove the barrier between them
- [ ] Note we use a library called `styled-component`
  - [ ] Show the [styled components website](https://styled-components.com/)
  - [ ] The library is already installed in our Next.js template

### First Styled Component: Button

- [ ] Create a new file: `components/Button.js`
- [ ] Import `styled`
- [ ] Explain we choose the HTML tag to be rendered after `styled.`
- [ ] Explain directly after the tag name we write a template string
  - [ ] The syntax looks a bit unexpected, but it's just a template string as we know it
- [ ] Write styles for the button
- [ ] Mention we are using a CSS custom property for the color. We'll have a look into it soon

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
  all: unset;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: white;
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
`;
```

- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Add the styled button to the page

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Start the dev server
- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate the button is displayed with the styles we applied

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Nested styles

- [ ] Explain we can nest styles inside a styled component with `&`
  - [ ] Mention it is possible to use type selectors, but we should not use it: it brings potential for conflicting styles
  - [ ] Point out we should use it for `pseudo elements` or `pseudo classes`
- [ ] Open the `components/Button.js` file
- [ ] Give an example by adding `hover` styles to the button

```jsx
export default styled.button`
  /* ... */

  &:hover {
    color: black;
    background-color: var(--primary-background);
  }
`;
```

- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate the button's hover state

### Global Styles

- [ ] Mention we used CSS custom properties (variables) for colors in the code so far
- [ ] Point out the corresponding declarations are global styles
- [ ] Explain recently we used a `styles.css` file for global styles. Now we use the file `styles.js`
- [ ] Open `styles.js`
- [ ] Explain that `styled-components` gives us a function called `createGlobalStyle`
- [ ] Explain we can add all global styles here. Show the color declarations with the `:root` selector
- [ ] Open the `pages/_app.js` file
- [ ] Point out that code added here is available for all pages in the Next.js app
- [ ] Demonstrate that's why we import `GlobalStyles` here

### Add Styles to the Link component

- [ ] Explain we can use `styled-components` to apply styles to other components
- [ ] Point out we can style the `Link` component from Next.js
- [ ] Create a new file: `components/Link.js`
- [ ] Write styles to style a link

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled(Link)`
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--primary-color);

  &:hover {
    color: var(--secondary-color);
  }
`;
```

- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Add a paragraph with a link to the page

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
    <p>
      This is a <Link href="/">styled link</Link>.
    </p>
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Open the browser and demonstrate the styled link

### Using Props: Interpolate a Value

- [ ] Mention that extending styles is just one approach to visual variants
- [ ] Highlight that another, more flexible approach is using props inside of our styled components
- [ ] Mention we like to create a wrapping container to add some spacing between the elements
- [ ] Create a new file: `components/Container.js`
- [ ] Write the code for this component

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  gap: 2rem;
  margin-block-end: 2rem;
`;
```

- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Wrap the `Container` component around the other components

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <Container>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Container>

    <Container>
      <p>
        This is a <Link href="/">styled link</Link>.
      </p>
    </Container>
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Open the `components/Container.js` file
- [ ] Explain we like to change the `flex-direction` and control it from the outside with a prop, when using this component
- [ ] Highlight that we are writing a JavaScript template string and can use interpolation with `${}`
- [ ] When interpolating within a styled component, we can write a function that receives all props passed to the component
- [ ] Write the code to interpolate the `direction` prop

```jsx
flex-direction: ${({ direction = "row" }) => direction};
```

- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Add another `Button`
- [ ] Demonstrate we can overwrite the default direction value of `row` via the prop `direction` on `Container` around the buttons

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <Container direction="column">
      <Button>Click me</Button>
      <Button>Click me not</Button>
    </Container>

    {/* ... */}
  </>
);
```

### Using Props: Ternary for a value

- [ ] Mention that we can use the ternary operator to check a prop's value and apply different styles based on this value
- [ ] Go to `components/Button.js`
- [ ] Explain that we like to change the `background-color` based on a `color` prop
- [ ] Mention that the interpolation with `${}` looks quite the same as before, but we now check the `props`'s value with the ternary operator
- [ ] Write the code to interpolate the `color` prop:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

export default styled.button`
  /* ... */

  background-color: ${({ color }) =>
    color === "danger" ? "var(--secondary-color)" : "var(--primary-color)"};

  /* ... */
`;
```

- [ ] Explain that we would have to write different BEM modifiers to the `className` prop when using BEM. We would need to match the classnames to the styles in another file. This makes it more complicated than influencing the styles directly, like we just did
- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Add the prop `color="danger"` to one of the buttons

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <Container>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
      <Button color="danger">Click me not</Button>
    </Container>
    {/* ... */}
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Point out we can combine the approach of extending component styles and using props
- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate the danger button

### Using Props: `css` block / Complex Component

- [ ] Note that we are going to create a slightly more complex component
  - [ ] A "normal" component combined with a styled component
- [ ] Create a new file: `components/InfoBox.js`

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledInfoBox = styled.section`
  padding: 2rem;
  border: 0.25rem solid black;
`;

export default function InfoBox({ title, message }) {
  return (
    <StyledInfoBox>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{message}</p>
    </StyledInfoBox>
  );
}
```

- [ ] Explain we can write the styled component above it's parent component in the same file
  - [ ] We can prefix the component name with `Styled` here
  - [ ] If we need the styled component in another place later, we can refactor the code then and move it to its own file
- [ ] Open the `pages/index.js` file
- [ ] Add the `InfoBox` component

```jsx
return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    <Container>
      <InfoBox title="This is an info" message="Read it carefully!" />
    </Container>
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Explain we like to have the three different variants of the `InfoBox`: default, success, error
- [ ] Note we can use the `direction` prop of `Container` we introduced earlier
- [ ] Write the code to add the prop and the two variants to the page. Point out we use the `variant` prop

```jsx
return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    <Container direction="column">
      <InfoBox title="This is an info" message="Read it carefully!" />
      <InfoBox
        title="It worked"
        message="You have done it!"
        variant="success"
      />
      <InfoBox title="Error" message="Something went wrong!" variant="error" />
    </Container>
  </>
);
```

- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate we see all three info boxes, but they have the same styling
- [ ] Open the file: `components/InfoBox.js`
- [ ] Point out, that we want to style multiple CSS properties for each variant: `color` and `border-color`
- [ ] Explain that using the ternary operator is fine for adapting single CSS property value based on a prop
- [ ] Note that, if there are several CSS styles based on the same prop, the ternary operator would not be a good solution
  - [ ] You will repeat a lot of code (interpolation, arrow function, checking the prop's value)
  - [ ] This code is hard to read
- [ ] Explain that we can not only interpolate the value of a CSS property, but multiple lines of CSS code
- [ ] Explain we can use the logical AND operator (`&&`) to interpolate the following code only, if the condition is true
  - [ ] It's like conditional rendering with the ternary operator, but without an else case
- [ ] Explain we can interpolate multiple lines of CSS code with the `css` function (don't forget to import it)

```jsx
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

const StyledInfoBox = styled.section`
  padding: 2rem;
  border: 0.25rem solid black;

  ${({ variant }) =>
    variant === "success" &&
    css`
      color: var(--primary-color);
      border-color: var(--primary-color);
    `}

  ${({ variant }) =>
    variant === "error" &&
    css`
      color: var(--secondary-color);
      border-color: var(--secondary-color);
    `}
`;
```

- [ ] Read the `variant` prop in the `InfoBox` component and pass it to `StyledInfobox`

```jsx
export default function InfoBox({ title, message, variant }) {
  return (
    <StyledInfoBox variant={variant}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{message}</p>
    </StyledInfoBox>
  );
}
```

- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate the visual variant of the info box

### Using Google Fonts

- [ ] Explain with Next.js we can add fonts from the free Google Fonts library very easily
  - [ ] Point out this is not a feature of `styled-components`, but Next.js
- [ ] Show the [Google Fonts website](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [ ] Note that we can import the fonts in Next.js directly, for example in our global styles
- [ ] Open the `styles.js` file
- [ ] Import a font from `next/font`. Demonstrate autocomplete for the font name
- [ ] Explain the import gives a function we need to call
  - [ ] We should pass a configuration object to the function call to define the `subset` we need
  - [ ] A font has subsets for different letters, like: Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic
  - [ ] The more subsets you include, the bigger the file size get's
  - [ ] We need only `latin` for our projects

```jsx
import { Open_Sans } from "next/font/google";

const openSans = Open_Sans({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export default createGlobalStyle`
  /* ... */
 
  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: ${openSans.style.fontFamily}; 
    padding: 2rem;
  }
`;
```

- [ ] Open the app in the browser and demonstrate the font has changed

### `vscode-styled-components` plugin

- [ ] Point out we want to have syntax highlight in our IDE when writing in CSS-in-JS with styled components
- [ ] Show the [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components) and recommend to install it

---

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](react-styled-components.md) and the
      [challenges](challenges-react-styled-components.md) to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

CSS-in-JS, styled components, createGlobalStyle, Next.js font

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

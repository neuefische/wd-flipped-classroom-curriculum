# JS Array Methods

## Learning objectives

- Understanding basic array methods
  - `.includes`
  - `.forEach`
  - `.map`
  - `.find`
  - `.filter`

---

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

Most often, we have information stored in an array (of objects). There are several options to work
with this information:

- execute the same code for each object (e.g. create cards)
- filter objects for specific criteria
- create a new array with only parts of the information
- How do you check whether at least one element is included in an array?
- How do you find an specific object in an array?

---

### Required

- JS Functions
- JS Objects and Arrays
- (JS Loops)

## Session Guide

### What are Array Methods?

- Show the students that arrays not only store data, but also provide methods to work with the data.
- Explain `.includes` and use it as an example to show how to use methods on an array, i.e.
  ```js
  strings.includes("React"); // true
  ```
- Highlight that there are a lot of different methods on arrays, each with its own use case.

### `forEach`

- Explain, that some array methods require a so called callback function as an argument.
- Point out, that these functions are called automatically for each element in the array.
- Write a simple forEach loop for the `strings` array:
  ```js
  strings.forEach(function (firstParameter) {
    console.log(firstParameter);
  });
  ```
  > ðŸ’¡ using the classic function syntax might confuse students at first, but it highlights, that we write a function "declaration" which is important for understanding callback functions.
- Highlight, that the callback function is "anonymous", since it has no name.
- Show that the first parameter of the callback function is always a single element of the array.
- Explain, that it is more common to use the arrow notation for the callback function.
- As a second example, use `forEach` to log the names of all games to the console of the demo:

  ```js
  games.forEach((game) => {
    console.log(game.name);
  });
  ```

- Show how forEach can be used meaningfully on a web page: Use `forEach` to create a card for each game, i.e.:

  ```js
  games.forEach((game) => {
    const articleElement = document.createElement("article");
    const titleElement = document.createElement("h2");
    const descriptionElement = document.createElement("p");

    titleElement.textContent = game.name;
    descriptionElement.textContent = game.description;

    articleElement.append(titleElement);
    articleElement.append(descriptionElement);

    gamesContainer.append(articleElement);
  });
  ```

- Highlight, that we will now get to know some more array methods that utilize callback functions.

### `map`

- Explain `map`:

  - Can transform each element of an array.
  - Transformed elements are stored in a **newly created array** returned by `map`.
  - The elements in the original array are not being altered.
  - You define the kind of transformation in the callback function and **return** the transformed element.

  ```js
  const upperCaseStrings = strings.map((string) => {
    return string.toUpperCase();
  });
  ```

- Show the shorthand syntax for a single return:

  ```js
  const upperCaseStrings = strings.map((string) => string.toUpperCase());
  ```

- Highlight, that the returned value does not have to be the same type as the original array:
  ```js
  const gameNames = games.map((game) => game.name);
  ```

### `find`

-Explain `find`:

- Show, that we can use the `find` method to get a single element from the array that satisfies a certain condition.
- Explain that `find` consumes a callback function that is executed for every element of the array.
- This callback function will check a specific condition and needs to return either `true` or `false`.
- Once the callback function returns true, the execution is stopped and the find function returns the respective object.
- When no element is found, it returns `undefined`. We have to keep this in mind to avoid an error when rendering an undefined value (we can use optional chaining for this purpose or an if-else statement).

```js
const searchResult = games.find((game) => {
  if (game.name === "Attack of the Mutant Camels") {
    return true; // this "game" becomes the searchResult
  } else {
    return false;
  }
});
console.log(searchResult);
```

```js
const searchResult = games.find(
  (game) => game.name === "Attack of the Mutant Camels"
);
console.log(searchResult);
```

### `filter`

- Explain `filter`:
  - Like `find`, but it returns every element of the array that satisfies a certain condition as a **new array**.
  - Similar to `find`, you provide a callback function for checking a condition.
  - If the condition is met, the callback function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.
    - `true`: The element will be added to the new array.
    - `false`: The element will be ignored.
  - The elements in the original array are not being altered.
  - The created array is likely to have a shorter length than the original array.
  ```js
  const gamesBefore2000 = games.filter((game) => game.publishingYear < 2000);
  console.log(gamesBefore2000);
  ```

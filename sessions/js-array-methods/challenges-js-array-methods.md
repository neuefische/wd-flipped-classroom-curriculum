# Challenges: JS Array Methods

## 1. Color Boxes (`forEach`)

Solve this
[Codesandbox challenge](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/for-each?file=/README.md).

## 2. `map`

## 3. `filter`

Solve this
[Codesandbox challenge](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/filter?file=/README.md).

## 4. Repetition: `map`and `filter`

Solve this
[Codesandbox challenge](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/repetition?file=/README.md).

## 5. `document.querySelectorAll`

Go to this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)

- Open the developer tools
- Open the javascript console

You can write javascript code into the console and execute it

- Use `document.querySelectorAll` to retrieve a list of all `h2` elements on this page
- Log the result to the console and inspect the result

## 6. Single Page Application

Up to now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following codesandboxes, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

- [SPA_01: a working solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_01?file=/README.md)
- [SPA_02: simplified with `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_02?file=/README.md)
- [SPA_03: `forEach` within `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_03?file=/README.md)

**Task:**

Working in groups, use the codesandboxes above; make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it (don't worry, we are not going to ask you to do so).

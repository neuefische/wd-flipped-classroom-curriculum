# Challenges: JS Array Methods

## Color Boxes (`forEach`)

Solve the _Color Boxes (`forEach`)_ challenge on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/for-each?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/for-each -i
```

## `map`

Solve the _`map`_ challenge on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/map?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/map -i
```

## `filter`

Solve the _`filter`_ challenge on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/filter?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/filter -i
```

## Repetition: `map`and `filter`

Solve the _Repetition: `map`and `filter`_ challenge on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/repetition?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/repetition -i
```

## `document.querySelectorAll`

Go to this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll),
open the developer tools and then open the JavaScript console.

You can write JavaScript code into the console and execute it.

Use `document.querySelectorAll` to retrieve a list of all `h2` elements on this page.

Log the result to the console and inspect the result.

## Single Page Application

Up until now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following CodeSandboxes, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

- [SPA 1: a working solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-1?file=/README.md)
- [SPA 2: simplified with `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-2?file=/README.md)
- [SPA 3: `forEach` within `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-3?file=/README.md)

Working in groups, use the CodeSandboxes above. Make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it.

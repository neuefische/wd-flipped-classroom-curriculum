## Bonus: Single Page Application

(difficulty: ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)

Up until now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following examples, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

SPA 1: a working solution:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-1
```

SPA 2: simplified with `forEach`:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-2
```

`forEach` within `forEach`:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-3
```

Working in groups, use the examples above. Make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it.

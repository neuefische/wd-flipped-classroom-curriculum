## Learning objectives

- [ ] understanding JS as a developing programming language
- [ ] destructuring assignment
- [ ] rest and spread syntax

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ğŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

JS is evolving on a regular basis. There are modern syntax additions which come in quite handy, as
`destructuring assignment`, `rest syntax` and `spread syntax`.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

The `destructuring assignment`, the `rest syntax` and the `spread syntax` are very useful features
to make the code more readable. Besides, they are widely used in modern JavaScript and, in
particular, React projects.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

- JS Basics
- JS Variables and Functions
- JS Objects and Arrays

---

## Inform: Session Guide

- [ ] Note that JavaScript is a developing language and new features are added continuously.
- [ ] Name the latest features students will learn in this session: `destructuring assignment`,
      `rest syntax`, and `spread syntax`.

You can use the following demo:

- [Demo Start](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-modern-syntax/demo-start?file=/index.js)
- [Demo End](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-modern-syntax/demo-end?file=/index.js)

### Destructuring Assignment - Objects

- [ ] Explain the `destructuring assignment` in general:

  - [ ] easily unpack properties from objects or values from arrays into distinct variables
  - [ ] does not mutate the original object or array

- [ ] Explain `object destructuring`:
  - [ ] remind students how to extract variables in the known way
  - [ ] destructure the object into its keys as variables

```js
const tree = {
  name: "oak",
  age: 1200,
  scientificName: "quercus",
};

/*
const name = tree.name;
const age = tree.age;
const scientificName = tree.scientificName;
*/

const { name, age, scientificName } = tree;
```

#### Renaming the variable

- [ ] Show how a property can be renamed while destructuring an object with a colon (`:`) :

```js
const { name: colloquialName } = tree;
```

#### Default value

- [ ] Show how to set a default value of a property with an equal sign (`=`):

```js
const { keepsLeavesInWinter = false } = tree;
```

#### Rest syntax in object destructuring

- [ ] Explain that the rest syntax(`...`) can be used to collect all other properties and extract
      them into one variable:

```js
const { name, ...information } = tree;

console.log(information); // {age: 1200, scientificName: 'quercus',}
```

---

### Destructuring Assignment - Arrays

- [ ] Explain how `array destructuring` differs from `object destructuring`:
  - [ ] In an array, there is no key to be used as a variable name.
  - [ ] The variable name is set in the very moment of destructuring.
  - [ ] Its value depends on its index.

```js
const animals = ["Lion", "Tiger", "Penguin", "Bear", "Whale"];

const [lion, tiger, penguin, bear, whale] = animals;
```

#### Ignoring Values

- [ ] Show that values are ignored if there is no name at the specific index.

```js
const [lion, , penguin, bear, whale] = animals;

console.log(penguin);
console.log(tiger); // not defined
```

#### Rest syntax in array destructuring

- [ ] Explain that the rest syntax (`...`) can be used to collect all other values and extract them
      into one variable:

```js
const [lion, tiger, penguin, ...rest] = animals;

console.log(lion);
console.log(tiger);
console.log(rest[1]); // 'Whale'
```

---

### Rest Syntax when Declaring Functions

- [ ] The rest syntax (`...`) collects all values given and returns an array containing these
      values. E.g. `(...args) => console.log(args)` â†’ `args` is an array with all arguments passed
      to the function.
- [ ] Note that it's used for `destructuring assignments` or declaring function parameters.

```js
function showZooAnimals(...allAnimals) {
  console.log(allAnimals);
  return `My zoo consists of the following animals: ${allAnimals.join(", ")}.`;
}

console.log(showZooAnimals("Monkey", "Crocodil", "Pig"));
```

---

### Spread Syntax

- [ ] Mark the spread syntax as the opposite of the rest syntax:
  - [ ] splits an array into its elements and makes them accessible
  - [ ] used when declaring array / object literals or calling functions.

```js
console.log(showZooAnimals(lion, tiger, ...rest));

const newAnimals = ["Whale", "Dolphin", "Wolf"];

console.log(showZooAnimals(...newAnimals));
```

#### Spread: Add another value

- [ ] Show an example how to declare an array with the help of spread syntax.
  - [ ] Create a new array from the old one and add a new value at the end.

```js
const animalFood = ["Meat", "Apple", "Banana", "Carrot"];

const newAnimalFood = "Fish";

const allAnimalFood = [...animalFood, newAnimalFood];
```

#### Spread for concatenating two arrays

- [ ] Similar to add a new value, use `spread syntax` to concatenate two arrays:

```js
const allMyAnimals = [...newAnimals, ...animals];

console.log(allMyAnimals);

console.log(showZooAnimals(...allMyAnimals));
```

---

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](js-modern-syntax.md) and the
      [challenges](challenges-js-modern-syntax.md) to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ğŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

Destructuring assignment, rest parameter, spread syntax

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

## Job Interviews - train your interview muscle

Job interviews are one of the most profitable skills you can learn! Boost your confidence and proficiency in foundational problem-solving and coding skills through practice interviews. Research shows that three mock interviews make you six times more likely to get hired. Mistakes during real interviews can be costly, but in a mock interview, they provide valuable learning opportunities. Embrace this chance to make mistakes now to learn and avoid them in real interviews.

## Mastering the Coding Challenges in Job Interviews 

1. Understand the Problem

- **Describe the function:**
  - What does it get? What does it return?
  - Example: "It gets an array of strings and returns a string, which is the longest string in the array."

- **Force yourself to be exact:**
  - Write down the problem instead of just thinking about it.
  - Use precise language and correct technical terms.

- **Explain example cases:**
  - Be able to explain why a certain input results in a specific output.
  - If any example is unclear, seek clarification to fully understand the problem.

-  **Repeat the task you are given:**
   -  Example: "_This function gets an array of strings as input and returns a string. This string should be the longest word in the array_."

- **Ask questions if needed:**
  - Clarify any uncertainties about the problem.

2. Come Up with a Solution in Plain Language
Very often you could solve the problem yourself but you still cannot come up with the small steps that you need as instructions for the computer.
In this case it helps to make yourself aware what happens in your brain when you solve the task. 

- **Solve the problem mentally:** Break down what happens in your brain when you solve the task.

- **Write precise instructions:**  Example: Instead of "_Check the number_" specify "_Compare the length of each word to the current longest word._"

- **Write steps as comments in the function body:** Ensure each step is detailed enough for someone else to execute without mistakes.

- **Use correct technical terms:** Practice using the right terms to describe your approach.

- **Communicate your thought process:**  Verbalise your steps and reasoning.

3. Translate the instructions into code

Now turn one comment after another to JavaScript code. Always ask yourself "Do i know how to implement this in JavaScript?". In case you are 100% sure: write down the code. If not you need to look it up.
It's not a problem at all looking things up but it is a huge problem if you randomly type stuff and hope to be right by accident. Don't do this.
After every line try to test it immediately. This will usually be done with a `console.log()`.
Always only concentrate on the small step that you are implementing right now. Avoid thinking about the whole problem at this point.

# Challenges: User Stories Workshop

In this workshop we will practice to write good and concise users stories for a fictional movies app.

## User Story 1

Take a look at the [movie app wireframes](./assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw). You can import this file at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) and get an overview about the features of the app.

Then, start writing the first user story:

- You can orient yourself with the guide "How to write ea user story?" inside the [excalidraw file](./assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw).
- Make sure to use full sentences, clean english and give your user story enough detail.

After around 30min, meet again with the coach to discuss the first user story.

## User Story 2 & 3

Continue with the other user stories. Keep in mind to describe every **new** element and possible interaction.

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> üí° Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- Writing code can become convoluted very quickly. We want to learn how to plan a new feature in an agile work environment.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

- Students need to understand the importance of user stories and how to write them.
- In the capstone the students need to be fluent in creating good user stories.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

- How can we prepare / plan a feature in an agile team without loosing flexibility?
- What makes a good user story?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

It is an option to start the session with these questions and follow up with the motivation of the
students:

- Remind the students about the agile workshop and what they learned about scrum, kanban, sprints and agile teams.

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

You can ask these questions:

- What needs to be included in a good user story?
- How can we protocol the upcoming features for all departments, not just for developers?

## Inform: Session Guide

### Example Project: Movie App

- [ ] Share this excalidraw file with the students or create a remote session for each group with this template:
      [user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw](assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw).
- [ ] Walk the students through the planned app and the 3 user stories with the wireframes
  1. List of current movies
  2. Detailspage for movies
  3. Watchlist
- [ ] Show the students where to fill in the different user stories
- [ ] Remind the students about the most important aspects of a user story:
  - [ ] Cover all new elements that should be displayed
  - [ ] Cover all user interactions or other behavior of the new feature
  - [ ] Write a detailed task list that could be a "recipe" for creating this feature

> üí° Optional: Share this link with the students üìΩÔ∏è¬†[Agile User Stories - How to write a good User Story?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEPLaYcdgeg) ~20min

## Challenge

- [ ] Split the students in groups of 3-5 and share the [excalidraw file](assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw) with them.
  > üí° Show the students how to import an excalidraw file in the web application and how to start a group session.
- [ ] Let the students work on the first user story
- [ ] Meet the students after ~ 30min to check the results
- [ ] Give feedback on what to improve hand out the example solution of the first user story.
- [ ] Let the students work on the remaining 2 user stories.

## Recap

- [ ] Check in with the students and make sure that they added enough details in their user stories
- [ ] Give the students the example solutions for the user stories .

## Suggestions for this self-directed learning afternoon

### 💡 Recap the sessions from this week with AI.

This week so far you have started to learn about some key fundamental concepts in JavaScript and also learned about CSS more in-depth.

Did you understand all the concepts?

**Test yourself!**

Here are some ideas for prompts you can ask the AI tool of your choice:

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> ```
> I started learning JavaScript this week.
> Analyse this text and form 10 questions to quiz me on the topics mentioned in the document.
> Afterwards evaluate my answers one by one.
> ```
>
> copy and paste the handout of your choice to your AI tool

### 💡 Reread handouts from this week.

You are the type of learner that needs to read something to wrap your head around it?
Reread the handout we provide for each session.

They are a great resource also for looking up single topics that you want to recap.

### 💡 Repeat the challenges from the last sessions.

Are there any challenges that you couldn't finish this week? Now is the perfect time to go back and try to solve them.

Did you find it hard to understand some task? No problem, you can ask the AI tool to rewrite or translate it for you.

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> copy and paste the challenge text to your AI tool
>
> ```
> Please rewrite this task in German.
> ```
>
> If you can give context or have a preference on how the task should be rewritten, add it to the prompt.
> (e.g., in bullet points, with bionic reading, etc.)

### 💡 Work on your Quiz App

Are you satified with your Quiz App? If not, now is the time to improve it. The next Recap Project will still be dealing with the Quiz App, so make sure you are satisfied with the HTML Structure and the CSS Styling.

Additionally review a QuizApp from someone in your group. It's not the goal to give a perfect review, but to start a conversation about code. It's the easiest and most fun way to learn about code.

### 💡 Solve the [additional challenges](./challenges-self-directed-learning-2.md).

Need more practice? We have prepared some additional challenges for you.
We recommend you to solve them on your own first. (On your own means you are allowed to Google, use the handouts, etc.) If you get stuck, ask your group for help.

(Some challenges might not be suitable depending on the sessions you encountered until now. Check the "required sessions" list to see if you have the knowledge to solve the challenge.)

> ❗️ Remember:
>
> Don't let the AI tool just generate code for you. Always type the code into your editor yourself.
>
> Do evaluate and discuss your ideas with the AI.
> It can provide valuable suggestions that you haven't considered yet.
>
> Do experiment as you go!
> The more you get to know the AI model, the better you can use it to your true advantage.

## Good luck and have fun! 🚀

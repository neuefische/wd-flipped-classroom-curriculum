## Return Statements

Functions are an incredible versatile and central tool in most programming languages. We already
learned how to pass values into a function with input parameters. But a function can also return a
value back to the place where it was called. This is done via a `return statement`.

```js
function add3Numbers(first, second, third) {
	const sum = first + second + third;
	return sum;
}
```

The `return statement` begins with the keyword `return` followed by an expression. This this case,
the expression is the variable sum. Its value is returned by the function and can be stored when the
function is called:

```js
const firstSum = add3Numbers(1, 2, 3);
// the return value is stored in "firstSum", namely 6

const secondSum = add3Numbers(4, 123, 33);
// the return value is now stored in "secondSum", namely 160
```

> 💡 An expression is anything that produces a value: a variable, a hardcoded value like `true` or
> `6`, a math operation like `2 + 3` or even another function call!
> [This article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/) explains this in
> greater depth.

By this, we can outsource computations and / or decision processes and continue using the returned
value in the program.

A function can return only one expression value, but can have multiple return statements, in
combination with if else statements for example:

```js
function checkInputLength(inputString) {
	if (inputString.length > 3) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
```

## Early Return Statements

As soon as a return statement is reached in a function call, the function execution is ended. The
following `console.log()` is therefore never reached:

```js
function testFunction() {
	return 'a returned string';

	console.log('I am never logged in the console.');
}
```

This behavior can be used to our advantage as early return statements. Sometimes we want to execute
certain parts of our code only if a condition applies. We can check this with an if else statement.
When multiple conditions are in place, the code becomes harder to read and to understand:

```js
function setBackgroundColor(color) {
	if (typeof color === 'String') {
		if (color.startsWith('#')) {
			if (color.length >= 7) {
				body.style.backgroundColor = color;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

An alternative approach is to terminate the function with early return statements:

```js
function setBackgroundColor(color) {
	// first condition
	if(typeOf color !== 'String') {
		return;
	}

	// second condition
	if(!color.startsWith('#')) {
		return;
	}

	// third condition
	if(color.length < 7) {
		return;
	}

	// only if all 3 conditions are passed the final line of code is executed.
	body.style.backgroundColor = color;
}

```

This way of writing the code is more readable

💡 Hint: A return statement can be left empty, the returned value is then `undefined`.

## Arrow Function Expressions

Next to the classic function declaration, JavaScript has a second way to write functions as
`arrow function expressions`:

```js
const addNumbers = (first, second) => {
	return first + second;
};
```

The function is saved like a variable with the keyword `const`. The parameters are written normally
in round brackets followed by an fat arrow `=>`. Then the function body is written in curly
brackets.

### Implicit Return Statements

The advantage of arrow functions are possible shorter notations when certain criteria apply:

1. Omit the round brackets around the parameters: This is possible, if there is only one input:
   ```js
   const addOne = number => {
   	return number + 1;
   };
   ```
2. Implicit return statements: If the function consists only of a return statement, the curly
   brackets and the return keyword can be omitted:
   ```js
   const addNumbers = (first, second) => {
   	return first + second;
   };
   ```
   can be rewritten as:
   ```js
   const addNumbers = (first, second) => first + second;
   ```

> 💡 This shorthand notation comes in handy as soon as we work with callback functions in a few
> days. So try to remember this feature.

> 💡 Maybe you remember the syntax of the `addEventListener` method. We encountered these arrow
> functions there already!

> ```js
> button.addEventListener('click',() => {
> 	...
> })

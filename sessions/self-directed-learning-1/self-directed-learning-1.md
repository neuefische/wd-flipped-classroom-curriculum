## Self-Learning with AI Tooling

On your journey to become a Web Developer, you will soon realize that _practice is truly the only thing that will make you better_. There are _no shortcuts_ to that, even in the age of AI.

AI is far from generating perfect code. If you were to try and just copy and paste your way through your career as a developer, you will run into frustration and limitations sooner rather than later.

In order to be able to judge the quality of the code generated by AI, you need to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Web Development. And the only way to get there is, you guessed it - practice.

Luckily, there are some easily accessible AI Tools out there that can be customized in a way that is perfectly adapted to your learning needs.

> ❗️ We strongly recommend you, to not use AI tools with code completion features, like GitHub Co-Pilot at this point. You need the practice of writing code for yourself. Only this way you can truly understand the different code patterns and concepts.

In the following, we have prepared a list of ideas on how you can use this afternoon to practice and learn in a self-directed way, including some ideas on how to include AI tools in the process and in what ways you shouldn't use them.

## Suggestions for this self-directed learning afternoon

### 💡 Recap the sessions from this week with AI.

This week you have already learned about GitHub and Markdown, HTML and the Web, the basics of CSS and maybe you even started to learn more in-depth about git.

Did you understand all the concepts?

**Test yourself!**

Here are some ideas for prompts you can ask the AI tool of your choice:

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> ```
> I want to test my knowledge.
> Give me the 10 most important keywords that I should know about CSS Flexbox.
> Don't provide an explanation for the keywords.
> I will explain them one by one and you correct my answers.
> ```

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> ```
> I started learning HTML and CSS this week.
> Ask me 10 questions that will test a fundamental understanding of these topics.
> Afterwards evaluate my answers one by one.
> ```

> :exclamation: Adjust the topics to your needs. Which session did you find most challenging this week? Start with this one!

### 💡 Reread handouts from this week.

You are the type of learner that needs to read something to wrap your head around it?
Reread the handout we provide for each session.

They are a great resource also for looking up single topics that you want to recap.

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> copy and paste the handout to your AI tool
>
> ```
> Analyse this text and quiz me on the most important topics mentioned in the document.
> ```

### 💡 Repeat the challenges from the last sessions.

Are there any challenges that you couldn't finish this week? Now is the perfect time to go back and try to solve them.

Did you find it hard to understand some task? No problem, you can ask the AI tool to rewrite it for you.

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> copy and paste the challenge text to your AI tool
>
> ```
> Please rewrite this task in a more comprehensive way.
> ```
>
> If you can give context or have a preference on how the task should be rewritten, add it to the prompt.
> (e.g., in bullet points, with bionic reading, etc.)

### 💡 Work on your Personal Website.

It might be tempting to let AI just generate the whole website - but that is not what we are here for. You want to learn what possibilities you have in order to create something from scratch. What kind of elements are out there, just waiting to be used to create a beautiful semantic website.

We recommend you to try and sketch the first draft of your website on paper. Visually at first, then you try to pick the elements you need to create it. AI can help you here, for example:

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> ```
> I am working on my personal Website in HTML and CSS.
> I want to add a table with my prior work experience.
> I was considering working with a table element.
> Do you have any other suggestions?
> ```

You can even get a code review from the AI tool:

> Prompt idea 🤖
> copy and paste your HTML page to your AI tool
>
> ```
> I am working on my personal Website in HTML.
> This is my code so far. Can you give me some feedback?
> Focus especially on semantics and correct usage of the elements.
> Don't provide me with the solution or code snippets, just give me hints on what I could improve.
> ```
>
> copy and paste the HTML you wrote to your AI tool

### 💡 Solve the [additional challenges](./challenges-self-directed-learning-1.md).

Need more practice? We have prepared some additional challenges for you.
We recommend you to solve them on your own first. If you get stuck try and check out

> ❗️ Remember:
>
> Don't let the AI tool just generate code for you. Always type the code into your editor yourself.
>
> Do evaluate and discuss your ideas with the AI.
> It can provide valuable suggestions that you haven't considered yet.
>
> Do experiment as you go!
> The more you get to know the AI model, the better you can use it to your true advantage.

## Project Scaffolding

Project scaffolding is the process of creating a new project. You will use the
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) tool to create a new React
project automatically.

> 💡 In principle, you could create a new React project from scratch. However, this would be a lot
> of work and we would have to set up a lot of things ourselves. For example, you would have to set
> up a development server, a build process and a test runner. You would also have to configure up a
> module bundler and a transpiler. This is a lot of work and you would have to do it every time you
> want to create a new project.

> 💡 Create React App, by the way, works quite similar to the `ghcd` tool you have probably already
> used.

## Create React App

Create React App is a tool that allows you to create a React project with a single command. It is a
great tool to get started with React.

### Folder Structure

Create React App scaffolds a folder structure for you with a lot of files and folders.

### Available Scripts

Create React App has a few more npm scripts than the ones you have seen so far. Besides starting a
development server and running tests, you can use them to build your app.

> 💡 With Create React App, the `test` script runs the tests in watch mode. This is different from
> the `test:watch` script you have seen so far.

> 💡 You should never need to use the `eject` script. It is a one-way operation that you can't undo.
> It is used to customize the configuration of your app.

### Adding a Stylesheet

You can directly import CSS files in your JavaScript files.

It is a common pattern to colocate your CSS with your components. This means that you have a CSS
file with the same name as the component that is imported in the components JavaScript file. It's a
good practice to use the BEM naming convention for your CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts
between components.

### Adding Images, Fonts and Files

You can directly import image files or fonts in your JavaScript files.

This is especially useful for SVG files, which you can import as React components.

## Session Guide

> This is an active learning session, this means that the session should take up to 5-10 minutes. The session is meant as an introduction into the topic, most concepts will be learned independently by the students with the help of the active learning material.

Our websites should be able to adjust and look good on a wide range of devices, ranging from mobile phones to desktop computers. Additionally, we need to consider accessibility features that might impact the way a website is shown. In this Active Learning session, we will explore two important tools that help us create responsive websites.

> How can I prepare a website to adapt to different scenarios like multiple screen sizes or different user needs?

### Responsive Layouts

- Show an example why response websites are necessary:

  - [Demo Non-Responsive Website](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-non-responsive)
  - [Demo Responsive Website](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-responsive)

- Highlight that over 50% of users browse the web on smartphones; therefore, building websites for multiple screen sizes is crucial.

- Explain that we mainly use two tools to create responsive layouts: media queries and responsive units.
- Explain that media queries

  - Enable us to apply styles based on the device's characteristics (screen size, resolution, preferred theme).
  - Media queries ensure our site's layout and appearance adapt effectively to various devices.

- Explain that Responsive Units
  - Allow elements to dynamically adjust their size using specific reference points (`rem` relative to base font size, `%` relative to screen size)
  - Ensure content looks appropriate across a range of devices.

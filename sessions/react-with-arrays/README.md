## Learning objectives

- [ ] Knowing how to use `.map()` to render lists in JSX
- [ ] Understanding how to render items from an array of objects
- [ ] Knowing to add a unique key for list items

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

React applications are seldom static. They often render data, which often comes in the form of arrays. This is why we need to learn how to render lists of items in React.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

Can you think of a way to render a list of items in React? Do any array methods come to mind?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

## Inform: Session Guide

Use this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-with-arrays/demo-start
```

You can check out the final version of this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-with-arrays/demo-end
```

### Introduce the Demo

- [ ] Show and explain the JSX in the `App` component
- [ ] Show and explain the `PokemonCard` component
- [ ] Point out that only a single Pokemon is displayed
- [ ] Show the `pokemons` array in the `App` component and explain, that we like to render all Pokemons from this array

### Rendering from Array

- [ ] Explain that we need to use the `.map()` function to render items from an array in JSX
- [ ] Explain that the `.map()` function is used to apply a transformation for each item within in array. We want to transform each object from the array into a `PokemonCard` in the JSX.
- [ ] Point out that curly braces `{}` in JSX can be used not only for variables, but for any JavaScript expression. We can use the `.map()` function directly within curly braces
- [ ] Change the JSX to render the Pokemon's names for now

  ```js
  <ul className="App__pokemons">
    {pokemons.map((pokemon) => (
      <li>{pokemon.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
  ```

### The `key` Prop

- [ ] Point out that something is wrong with the Code. ESLint indicates an error in the line we just wrote.
- [ ] Hover over the error squiggle line to show the message.

  > `Missing "key" prop for element in iterator`

- [ ] Explain that React needs to keep track of the individual elements we render in a list. We need to provide `unique identifier` per element by adding the `key` prop
- [ ] Change the code and add the `key` prop

  ```js
  <ul className="App__pokemons">
    {pokemons.map((pokemon) => (
      <li key={pokemon.id}>{pokemon.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
  ```

> ðŸ’¡ If you want, you can of course go into more detail about why React needs to keep track of the individual elements and how the `key` prop is used for this. Any real example that shows the problem will become very complex. Keep it simple and just explain that React needs a unique identifier for each element.

### Complete the demo

- [ ] Instead of rendering only the pokemon's names, render the `PokemonCard` component within the `.map()` function

  ```js
  <ul className="App__pokemons">
    {pokemons.map((pokemon) => (
      <li key={pokemon.id}>
        <PokemonCard
          id={pokemon.id}
          name={pokemon.name}
          types={pokemon.types}
          image={pokemon.image}
        />
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
  ```

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](react-with-arrays.md) and the
      [challenges](challenges-react-with-arrays.md) to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- We use the `map` function to dynamically render elements from an array in JSX. We need to put this code in curly braces `{}`.
- Each item needs a `unique identifier` passed via the `key` prop. In most cases, we want to use an `id`.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

map, array, key prop, unique identifier, keyed fragment

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

## Session Guide

In a normal document flow, block-level elements are displayed below each other. While this default behavior is useful, it often needs to be adjusted to create visually appealing layouts that are easy for users to navigate. Traditional styling methods like `float`, `position`, and `margin` can be used to distribute elements on a page, but these methods become increasingly complex and inflexible, especially when dealing with modern, responsive layouts. Modern web designs consist of many reusable parts (components) that need to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Flexbox offers a powerful solution to these challenges by providing a flexible and efficient way to control the layout of elements based on the available space.

> How can we create a horizontal navigation bar that adjusts to the viewport‚Äôs width by increasing the space between the navigation links?

### Document Normal Flow

- Show the code and the normal document flow of the demo.
- Note what we want to achieve:
  - a horizontal navigation bar that
  - adjusts to the viewport's width by increasing the space between the navigation links.

### General understanding: defining a flexbox, axis, and direction

- Explain how flexbox works in general:

  - We need to create a flexbox **container** as a wrapper.
  - All **direct children** are **flex-items** to which the styles are applied.

- Switch to the `index.html` and show that the common parent element (= container) for all navigation items is the `ul` with `class="menu"`.
- Switch to `styles.css` and identify the corresponding class selector `.menu {}`.
- Make the `ul` a flex container and show the difference in the browser:

```css
.menu {
  font-size: 22px;
  display: flex;
}
```

- Note that the **direction** of the flexbox is set via the `flex-direction` property which defaults to horizontal.
- Change the `flex-direction` to `column` and show the difference:

```css
.menu {
  font-size: 22px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

- Show the following image to recap and explain:
  - flex container
  - flex items
  - `flex-direction`: `row` (default) and `column`
    - The `flex-direction` property defines the `main-axis`.
    - The `cross-axis` is perpendicular.
  - Make the students aware of `justify-content` (main-axis) and `align-items` (cross-axis):
    - these properties define where to place the flex items along the `main-axis` / `cross-axis`;
    - we'll use them in the next step to adapt our flex items.

### Important CSS properties for flexbox

- Introduce the following flexbox properties and show the effect of different values:

> üí° To visualize the differences even better, you may want to give `.menu` and `.menu > li` a border.

- `justify-content`: Alignment on the `main-axis`
  - `flex-start` (default): Items are placed **at the start of the flex-direction**.
  - `center`: Items are **centered along the line**.
  - `space-between`: Items are **evenly distributed in the line**; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
  - `space-evenly`: Items are distributed so that the **spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal**.
- `align-items`: Alignment on the `cross-axis`
  - ‚ùóÔ∏è Make sure to set the `height` property on the flex container to show behavior.
  - `stretch` (default): Stretch items to **fill the container**.
  - `flex-start`: Items are placed **at the start of the cross axis**.
  - `flex-end`: Items are placed **at the end of the cross axis**.
  - `center`: Items are **centered in the cross-axis**.
- `gap`: Creates visual space between flex items.
- `flex-wrap`: Flex items can wrap into another row instead of being squashed into one row
  - `nowrap` (default): All flex items will be on one line.
  - `wrap`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.

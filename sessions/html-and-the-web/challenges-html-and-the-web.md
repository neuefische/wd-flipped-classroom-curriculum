# Challenges: HTML and the Web

## `<div>`-Salad

Solve the _`<div>`-Salad_ challenge on
[🔗 **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/html-and-the-web/div-salad)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/html-and-the-web/div-salad -i
```

Replace all the div tags in the code with semantic HTML. In case you need some ideas, you can refer
to the handout.

## Personal Website

In this challenge you will start creating your own personal website.

### Get started with HTML

Start working on the HTML markup of your personal website.

1. Create and switch to a new feature branch locally.
   > ❗️ Be careful never to work on your main branch. You should always introduce new features
   > through a feature branch and a pull request.
2. Think about the content you want to put on your website and its structure. You can use
   [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to create a draft of your personal website. Don't worry
   about the styling - we will take care of that later. If you need some ideas, refer to the
   wireframe down below. Don't spend too long on this task, it more important to start coding. You
   can always add new features to your draft later.
3. Start to put your ideas into code, giving your website structure and content. Use semantic HTML
   whenever possible. Work on one feature (on the respective branch) after another.
4. Commit your work on the feature branch whenever a new part of your website is done.
5. Create a pull request on GitHub. Send a link to the pull request to the course slack channel and
   request a review. While you wait, review someone elses pull request.
6. After committing requested changes and getting an approval for your pull request, merge your
   feature branch into the main branch.
   > 💡 Not getting an approval right away for your pull request is absolutely normal. Add or change
   > your code according to the suggestions. Don't let it discourage you and take it as a chance to
   > learn!

Here is an example of a structure for a website that you can draw inspiration from:

![Desktop Wireframe](assets/wireframe-desktop.png)

---

![Mobile Wireframe](assets/wireframe-mobile.png)

> ❗️ Your personal website won't look exactly like the wireframe for now, as many of the features
> need to be styled (to align horizontally for example). We will improve this during the next days.
> For now, don't focus on the looks, focus on including all relevant HTML elements.

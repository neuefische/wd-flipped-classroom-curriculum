# Challenges: HTML and the Web

## Active Learning

Welcome to this active learning session focused on exploring HTML and the Web in a self-directed way. As a developer, one of the most valuable skills is the ability to teach yourself effectively, so let's take some more steps in that direction.

> The active learning process involves the following steps:

1. Read and Understand the Document: Begin by carefully reading the document and familiarizing yourself with its contents.

1. Analyze the Examples: As you progress through the document, take your time to break down and comprehend the various examples provided. They appear as you keep scrolling down the page.

## Folder Structure

In previous lessons, we set up the following folder structure:

```js
web-bootcamp
├── session-notebook
└── web-challenges
```

> 💡 For better organisation, it's recommended to create subfolders within the `web-challenges` folder for each session, named according to the session title.

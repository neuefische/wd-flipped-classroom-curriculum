# Challenges: HTML and the Web

## Your Self-Guided HTML and Web Exploration

 While your coach delivered this session, we want to empower you to start building a crucial skill for any developer: **self-directed learning**. This session is designed to gently introduce you to the power of active learning, helping you discover HTML and the Web at your own pace.

Think of this as a guided journey where you'll learn **how to learn effectively**. As you go through the material, you'll be practicing the steps of active learning, which will be incredibly valuable throughout your studies and career.

Here's how to make the most of this session:

1. **Read and Understand:** Take your time to carefully read through the document. Don't rush!

2. **Analyze Examples:** As you scroll, you'll find various examples. Pause, break them down, and make sure you understand how they work. This is key to grasping the concepts.

3. **Note Your Questions:** Keep a text file or a piece of paper handy. As questions come up, write them down. We'll have a dedicated recap session to discuss them together.

## Folder Structure

In previous lessons, we set up the following folder structure:

> 💡 For better organisation, it's recommended to create subfolders within the `web-challenges` folder for each session, named according to the session title.

# Capstone Grouping and Setup

## Manual of Me

A [Manual of Me](assets/manual-of-me.md) is a comprehensive guide that details various aspects of your personality, preferences, habits, communication style, strengths, weaknesses, and any other information that someone might need to understand you better.

It could include things like your values, goals, interests and preferred ways of interacting with others. Essentially, it's a user's guide to understanding you as a unique individual.

Creating a manual of me in the context of a group project can be hugely beneficial:

- It can help to get a clear picture each member of the group.
- It summarizes the needs of each group member.
- It can assist in fostering the right way of communication for the given group.
- It guides decisions on how to distribute the project tasks effectively.

## Project Setup

You can find a guide on how to correctly setup your project repository and project board in the [web capstone docs](https://web-capstone-docs.neuefische.de/guides/project-setup).

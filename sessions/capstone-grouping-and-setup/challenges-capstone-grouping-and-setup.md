# Challenges: Challenges Capstone Grouping and Setup

## Decide on your favorite Project

Go through the list of available capstone projects and pick one you would like to implement.

## Manual of Me

Copy the [template](assets/manual-of-me.md) for the **Manual of Me** and start filling it out. You don't need to finish it in this session, but make sure that you have a complete manual at the end of the day.

You can follow these hints to get you started with the manual:

1. Don’t rush - take some time to think about your answers.
2. Be honest - don’t describe the person you want to be, but the person you are.
3. Ask others - get input from the people around you.
4. Keep it fresh - return to your manual and see if things have changed.

## Project Setup

Based on the guide in the [web capstone docs](https://web-capstone-docs.neuefische.de/guides/project-setup), start setting up the project for the capstone phase. Only one of you needs to create a remote repository and project board. Make sure to invite all team members as collaborators and to connect the repository to the project board.

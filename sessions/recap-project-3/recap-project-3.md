# Recap 3: Rick and Morty App

In this recap project you are going to create a single page app for browsing all the characters of
the famous tv show "Rick and Morty".

## Group work

Are going to work in a group. Create only one project per group using the following guide!

Create a new empty repository on github, link it to the created repository on your computer and push
the code.

Afterwards each member of the group clones the repository to their local machine.

> ðŸ’¡ Don't forget to work on feature branches, otherwise you might run into merge conflicts!

## Create the project (with starter code)

Open your terminal and navigate to the folder all your projects are located. Execute the following
command to create a new project based on a template:

`npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/recap-project-3/rick-and-morty-app -i`

After the project has been created on your computer, follow the instruction given in the `README.md`
file.

# JS Objects and Arrays

> ğŸ’¡ feel free to create a personal branch of this guide to add your own notes

## Learning objectives

Draft:

- [ ] students should be able to
  - create arrays,
  - read from arrays (via index)
  - manipulate arrays `myArr[2] = 42`
  - know the arrays `.length`
- [ ] they should know that arrays count from 0
- [ ] they should know arrays can hold mixed values
- [ ] they should know about `push()` and `pop()` (put unshift and shift into handout)
- [ ] maybe: `myArr.at(-1)` (handout?)
- [ ] nested arrays

- [ ] what is an object and what kind of objects did we already use?
  - `document`, `event`, queried dom elements, etc.
- [ ] students should be able to
  - create objects,
  - read from objects (dot and bracket notation)
  - manipulate object
  - delete properties `delete myObj.prop`
- [ ] nested objects
- [ ] arrays in objects / objects in arrays

- [ ] they should know what/how they can find (props, methods) by logging objects / arrays

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ğŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](js-objects-and-arrays.md) and the
      [challenges](challenges-js-objects-and-arrays.md) to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups of \_\_\_
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

## Checkout

> ğŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

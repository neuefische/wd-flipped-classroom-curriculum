## Practice Git

## Practice HTML

Create a new page and style it creatively. The page could be about:

- a cinema / theater,
- a restaurant,
- a music band/ favourite singer,
- a public administration office.

First decide about the information you'll need / want to show, design your page structure (pencil and paper go a long way) and then work on the HTML.

## Work on your Quiz App

Are you satisfied with your Quiz App? If not, now is the time to improve it. The next Recap Project will still be dealing with the Quiz App, so make sure you are satisfied with the HTML Structure and the CSS Styling.

Additionally review a QuizApp from someone in your group. It's not the goal to give a perfect review, but to start a conversation about code. It's the easiest and most fun way to learn about code.

## Practice JavaScript

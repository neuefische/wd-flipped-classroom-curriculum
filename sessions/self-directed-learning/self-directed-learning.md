# Self-Directed Learning

Today’s session, **Self-Directed Learning**, is dedicated time for you to catch up on your progress, work on any pending challenges, and focus on your **career** development.
## Today's Schedule

- **1 Hour**: Career Development (if applicable)
- **After Career Hour**: Time to work on any pending challenges or tasks.

## Career Development

If you have already attended an initial session with a career coach, we recommend setting aside an hour for career development. You can follow the self-study materials on the [Career Development LMS](https://login.neuefische.de/?domain=dashboard.neuefische.de). The LMS allows you to book weekly online group sessions for CV reviews with a career coach, available in both English and German. Remember, it’s essential to dedicate one hour per week to advancing your career development.

## After Career Hour

> 💡 Use this self-directed learning time as you see fit. The suggestions below provide ideas on how to make the most of this session.

### Self-Learning with AI Tools

As you progress on your journey to becoming a Web Developer, you will soon realize that _practice is essential for improvement_. There are _no shortcuts_, even in the age of AI.

AI-generated code is far from perfect. Relying solely on it can lead to frustrations and limitations.

To effectively evaluate AI-generated code, you need a solid understanding of web development fundamentals. And the only way to achieve that is through consistent practice.

Fortunately, there are AI tools available that can be customized to align with your learning goals.

> ❗️ We strongly recommend avoiding AI tools with code completion features, like GitHub Co-Pilot, at this stage. Writing code yourself is crucial for understanding different coding patterns and concepts.

Here are some suggestions on how to use this time effectively, including ways to responsibly incorporate AI tools:

### 💡 Recap This Week’s Sessions with AI

This week, you have covered essential foundational concepts. Did you fully understand them?

**Test yourself!**

Here are some AI prompt ideas for self-quizzing:

- For HTML and CSS

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I want to test my knowledge.
  > Give me the 10 most important keywords that I should know about CSS Flexbox.
  > Don't provide explanations for the keywords.
  > I will explain each one, and you correct my answers.
  > ```

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I started learning HTML and CSS this week.
  > Ask me 10 questions to test my understanding of these topics.
  > Afterwards, evaluate my answers one by one.
  > ```

  > ❗️ Adjust the topics to your needs. If there was a session you found challenging this week, start with that one!

- For JavaScript

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I started learning JavaScript this week.
  > Analyse this text and form 10 questions to quiz me on the topics covered.
  > Afterwards, evaluate my answers one by one.
  > ```
  >
  > Copy and paste the relevant handout into the AI tool of your choice.

### 💡 Reread This Week’s Handouts

If reading helps you absorb information, revisit the handouts provided for each session.
They are excellent resources for reviewing specific topics.

### 💡 Repeat Challenges from Previous Sessions

Are there any challenges you couldn’t finish this week? Now is a perfect time to revisit them.

If you struggled with a task, use an AI tool to clarify or translate the instructions for better understanding.

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> Copy and paste the challenge text into the AI tool.
>
> ```md
> Please rewrite this task in German.
> ```
>
> If you have specific preferences, include them in the prompt (e.g., in bullet points, with bionic reading, etc.).

### 💡 Solve [Additional Challenges](./assets/additional-challenges.md)

If you need more practice, explore the additional challenges we have prepared. Start by solving them on your own — use resources like Google or handouts as needed. If you get stuck, ask your group for help.

💡 Some challenges may not be suitable depending on your current progress. Check the “required sessions” list to ensure you have the knowledge to tackle each challenge.

> ❗️ Remember:
>
> Don’t let AI tools generate code for you — always type it out yourself.
>
> Discuss your ideas with AI. It can provide valuable suggestions you might not have considered.
>
> Experiment as you go. The more familiar you become with AI tools, the better you can leverage them for learning.

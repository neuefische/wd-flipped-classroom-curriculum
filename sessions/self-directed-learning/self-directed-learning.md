### Self-Learning with AI Tooling

On your journey to become a Web Developer, you will soon realize that _practice is truly the only thing that will make you better_. There are _no shortcuts_ to that, even in the age of AI.

AI is far from generating perfect code. If you were to try and just copy and paste your way through your career as a developer, you will run into frustration and limitations sooner rather than later.

In order to be able to judge the quality of the code generated by AI, you need to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Web Development. And the only way to get there is, you guessed it - practice.

Luckily, there are some easily accessible AI Tools out there that can be customized in a way that is perfectly adapted to your learning needs.

> ❗️ We strongly recommend you, to not use AI tools with code completion features, like GitHub Co-Pilot at this point. You need the practice of writing code for yourself. Only this way you can truly understand the different code patterns and concepts.

In the following, we have prepared a list of ideas on how you can use this afternoon to practice and learn in a self-directed way, including some ideas on how to include AI tools in the process and in what ways you shouldn't use them.

### 💡 Recap the sessions from this week with AI

This week so far you have started to learn about some key fundamental concepts.

Did you understand all the concepts?

**Test yourself!**

Here are some ideas for prompts you can ask the AI tool of your choice:

- For HTML and the Web and CSS

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I want to test my knowledge.
  > Give me the 10 most important keywords that I should know about CSS Flexbox.
  > Don't provide an explanation for the keywords.
  > I will explain them one by one and you correct my answers.
  > ```

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I started learning HTML and CSS this week.
  > Ask me 10 questions that will test a fundamental understanding of these topics.
  > Afterwards evaluate my answers one by one.
  > ```

  > :exclamation: Adjust the topics to your needs. Which session did you find most challenging this week? Start with this one!

- For JavaScript

  > Prompt idea 🤖
  >
  > ```md
  > I started learning JavaScript this week.
  > Analyse this text and form 10 questions to quiz me on the topics mentioned in the document.
  > Afterwards evaluate my answers one by one.
  > ```
  >
  > copy and paste the handout of your choice to your AI tool

### 💡 Reread handouts from this week

You are the type of learner that needs to read something to wrap your head around it?
Reread the handout we provide for each session.

They are a great resource also for looking up single topics that you want to recap.

### 💡 Repeat the challenges from the last sessions

Are there any challenges that you couldn't finish this week? Now is the perfect time to go back and try to solve them.

Did you find it hard to understand some task? No problem, you can ask the AI tool to rewrite or translate it for you.

> Prompt idea 🤖
>
> copy and paste the challenge text to your AI tool
>
> ```md
> Please rewrite this task in German.
> ```
>
> If you can give context or have a preference on how the task should be rewritten, add it to the prompt.
> (e.g., in bullet points, with bionic reading, etc.)

### 💡 Solve the [additional challenges](./assets/additional-challenges.md)

Need more practice? We have prepared some additional challenges for you.
We recommend you to solve them on your own first. (On your own means you are allowed to Google, use the handouts, etc.) If you get stuck, ask your group for help.

(Some challenges might not be suitable depending on the sessions you encountered until now. Check the "required sessions" list to see if you have the knowledge to solve the challenge.)

> ❗️ Remember:
>
> Don't let the AI tool just generate code for you. Always type the code into your editor yourself.
>
> Do evaluate and discuss your ideas with the AI.
> It can provide valuable suggestions that you haven't considered yet.
>
> Do experiment as you go!
> The more you get to know the AI model, the better you can use it to your true advantage.

# Self-Directed Learning

This session is dedicated to self-directed learning, allowing students to freely choose which topics they want to recap and practice.

## First Time

During the first self-directed learning session, show the students the [GitHub Discussions Board](###GitHub-Discussions-Board).

### GitHub Discussions Board

During self-directed learning time, students should post their questions on our discussions board. There is a dedicated category for self-directed learning, which students can use to ask questions and help each other. Coaches will also be available on the discussions board to answer questions.

Introduce the board to the students and explain how to use it:

- Show them where to find the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning).
- Demonstrate how to create a new topic.
- Show them how to reply to a topic.
- Explain how to mark a reply as the solution.
- Show them where they can find a [guide on how to use the discussions board during self-directed learning](https://github.com/neuefische/questions/wiki).

## Material for Students

Some students find it helpful to have some guidance and suggestions on what to work on. Therefore, we provide **optional** challenges for self-directed learning.

Feel free to add more resources based on your students’ needs. For example:

- Add a link to the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning) for student questions.
- Provide a link to [guides on how to ask good questions on our discussions board](https://github.com/neuefische/questions/wiki).
- Share a link to helpful videos that you recommend.
- Include a link to an article that concludes a difficult topic of the week.

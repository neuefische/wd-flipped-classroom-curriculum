## What is React and Why Do We Use It?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces. It allows developers to:

- Create **reusable components** to organize and simplify their code.
- Focus on **what the UI should look like** (declarative), while React handles the how behind the scenes.

Unlike **Vanilla JS**, where you manage the DOM manually, React abstracts this process for efficiency.

### Introduction to JSX

**JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML but behaves like JavaScript. It allows you to **describe the UI declaratively**.

```jsx
const element = <p>Hello World!</p>;
```

Key Points:

- JSX looks like HTML but is transformed into JavaScript that the browser can understand.
- Files containing JSX typically use the `.jsx` file extension.
- JSX expressions can include JavaScript code wrapped in curly braces `{}`

```jsx
const name = "React";
const element = <p>Hello {name}!</p>; // Outputs: Hello React!
```

### Imperative vs Declarative Programming

To understand the difference between imperative and declarative code, let's look at an example of a simple button.

> ❗️ The main difference between imperative and declarative code is that imperative code describes _how_ something should be built, and declarative code describes _what_ needs to be built.

#### Imperative Code in Vanilla JavaScript

You describe how the UI is built step by step.

```js
const button = document.createElement("button");
button.type = "button";
button.textContent = "click me";
button.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Hello World"));
document.body.append(button);
```

- We create the element with `document.createElement()`
- We set the button type,
- We set the text content
- We add the event listener
- We append the button to the body

#### Declarative Code in React + JSX

You describe what the UI should look like.

```jsx
const element = (
  <button type="button" onClick={() => console.log("Hello World")}>
    click me
  </button>
);
```

- We describe in JSX what element we want (in this case a button element)
- React figures out how to update the DOM according to our description

> 💡 A metaphor: Image you are really hungry. You have two options:
>
> The Vanilla JavaScript way would be to cook a meal yourself. You would have to go to the grocery store, buy the ingredients, prepare them, cook them, and finally eat them.
>
> There is also the React way: You could just order food from a restaurant. You would just have to tell them what you want to eat, and they (React) would take care of the rest.

## React Components

React components are reusable, independent building blocks of a React application. Each component combines logic and appearance and represents a part of the user interface that can be used multiple times.

> 💡 Components can be as 'small' as a button or as 'big' as an entire page.

### Creating a Component

- A component is a function that returns JSX.

```jsx
function Button() {
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => console.log("Hello World")}>
      click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Using Components

- Use the component as a custom HTML tag:

```js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button />
      <Button />
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key Rules:

- Components must have PascalCase names.
- Components must return JSX with one parent element.

This is a very powerful concept, because it allows us to reuse the same component in multiple places in our application.

## Nesting Elements

JSX elements in a React component can be nested the same way we have been nesting our HTML elements.

```jsx
function Card() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Some Text</p>
      <p>Some more Text</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Attributes

In most cases the names for attributes are the same as in HTML, but there are some exceptions. For example, the `class` attribute from HTML is called `className` in JSX.

```jsx
const element = <p className="text">Some Text</p>;
```

> 📙 Find out more about the [differences in attributes](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes)

---

Passing string values to attributes is done by using double quotes. To pass any JavaScript expression use curly braces.

```jsx
const myValue = "This is a string";
const input = <input type="text" value={myValue} minLength={5} />;
```

### Dynamic Values in JSX

To make components dynamic, you can insert JavaScript expressions into JSX using curly braces `{}`.

```js
export default function App() {
  const buttonText = "click with React";
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => console.log("Hello React!")}>
      {buttonText}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```js
const name = "Pawtricia";
const element = <p>My cat's name is {name}</p>;
```

```js
const a = 5;
const b = 10;

const element = (
  <p>
    {a} + {b} = {a + b}
  </p>
);
```

> 💡 You can only use **expressions** inside JSX. Statements like `if/else` or `for`-loops are not allowed.

## How React Renders

React needs a **root element** in the DOM to render your application. This root acts as the entry point where React mounts its components

**HTML**

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

In most projects, this code is already provided in templates or starters. A typical setup looks like this:

```js
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

- `App`: The root React component of your application.
- `StrictMode`: A development-only tool that highlights potential issues in your code without affecting the visible UI.

### How React Updates the DOM

React works **smart, not hard**. It uses the Virtual DOM to track changes and efficiently updates only the parts of the DOM that have changed compared to the last render.

Benefits:

- React avoids unnecessary updates, ensuring fast rendering.
- Focus remains consistent, and inputs keep their values.
- Declarative code is easier to write and understand.

## Nice to know: React, JSX, Transpilers and Bundlers

React uses JSX, a syntax extension that lets us write HTML-like code in JavaScript. However, JSX is not standard JavaScript, so it needs to be transformed into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand.

- Transpilers (e.g., Babel)

  - Convert JSX into standard JavaScript code that browsers can run.
  - Example: JSX like `<h1>Hello</h1>` gets converted to `createElement(...)`.

- Bundlers (e.g., Vite or Rollup)
  - Combine all project files (JS, JSX, CSS) into optimized bundles.
  - Automatically run the transpiler when needed.
  - Provide a development server with live reloading when you run:

```sh
  npm run dev
```

### Importing CSS Files

Bundlers allow you to use non-standard features, like importing CSS files directly into JavaScript:

```js
import "./styles.css";
```

- The bundler transforms this into a `<link>` tag in the final HTML.
- This simplifies managing styles in modern JavaScript projects.

---

## npm

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) is a package registry for JavaScript projects. It allows you to:

- Install and manage libraries (called packages):

```sh
  npm install package-name
```

- Run project scripts defined in `package.json`, like starting the development server.

```sh
  npm run dev
```

---

## `package.json`

The `package.json` file is the configuration file for your project. It includes:

- Metadata: Project name, version, and description.
- `dependencies`: Libraries your app needs to run.
- `devDependencies`: Tools needed for development (e.g., linters, bundlers).
- `scripts`: Shortcuts for running commands like starting a development server.

A `package.json` may look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A description of my app",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run …"
  },
  "author": "Alex Newfish",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "dependencies": {
    "my-dependency": "^10.4.1",
    "my-other-dependency": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "my-dev-dependency": "^8.0.105",
    "my-other-dev-dependency": "^0.1.6"
  }
}
```

### Installing dependencies

To install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, run:

```sh
 npm install
```

> 💡 Always run `npm install` after cloning a project to set up its dependencies.

- `node_modules`:

  - Contains all installed packages (dependencies).
  - **Do not commit this folder** to your repository as it is large and can be regenerated using npm install.
  - Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file to exclude it from version control.

- `package-lock.json`:
  - Stores the exact versions of installed dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments and team members.
  - **Should be committed** to the repository to avoid unexpected changes caused by newer versions of a package.

## Setting Up a React Project with Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) automates project scaffolding and setup, saving time.

> 💡 In principle, you could create a new React project from scratch. However, this would be a lot of work and we would have to set up a lot of things ourselves.

> 💡 Vite, by the way, works quite similar to the `ghcd` tool you have probably already used.

A new project is created by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
  npm create vite@latest my-react-app
```

- If running this command for the first time, you need to install the `create-vite` package, accept and continue.
- Select `React` as the framework and the `JavaScript` template (without SWC – speedy web compiler).
- Navigate into your project folder:

```sh
  cd my-first-react-app
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

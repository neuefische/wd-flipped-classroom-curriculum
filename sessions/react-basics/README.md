### Render Demo

Use this demo on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-basics/demo-render?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-basics/demo-render -i
```

- [ ] Show that react renders the `<h1>Hello World</h1>` into the `#root` div.
- [ ] Explain that we are not using a template literal in the `render` function, but a JSX
      expression.
  - [ ] JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
- [ ] Explain that it is a way to describe the DOM tree declaratively.
> ðŸ’¡ Additional information : A JavaScript compiler (like [babel](https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=false&corejs=3.21&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=DwEwlgbgfAEgpgGwQe2AenNIA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=env%2Creact%2Cstage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.20.6&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D)) will compiles our JSX into valid JavaScript, then the React library creates or updates DOM nodes.
  - [ ] If what we want to show changes, we give a new description (new JSX) to the render function.
  - [ ] React will then efficiently update the DOM. As we will see in a later Demo, React is very
        good at this.
- [ ] Point out, that we focus on the syntax of JSX for now.
  - [ ] Explain that we can use HTML tags in JSX and nest them as we would do in HTML.

### Demonstrate JSX

- [ ] Change the JSX in the render function to something like:

```jsx
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>
      I am rendered by <strong>React</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
);
```

- [ ] Explain (built-in) attributes in JSX
  - [ ] In HTML we can use attributes to add additional information to an element.
  - [ ] In JSX we can use attributes as well.
  - [ ] For example, we can add an `id` attribute to the `<h1>` element and a `className` attribute
        to the `<p>` element.

```jsx
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello World</h1>
    <p className="intro">
      I am rendered by <strong>React</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
);
```

- [ ] Explain that the `className` attribute is used instead of the `class` attribute.

> ðŸ’¡ There is a popular myth that `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. **This is not
> true.**  
> [`className` is just the property name the DOM API uses to set the class of an element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className).
> The
> [convention for using the JavaScript-centric DOM API name for properties](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes)
> is true for all HTML properties, not just for `class` (use `className` instead) and `for` (use `htmlFor` instead).
>
> This also means that properties need to be camel cased in JSX (e.g. `tabIndex` instead of
> `tabindex` and `readOnly` instead of `readonly`).

## Use values in JSX

- [ ] Explain that we need to insert dynamic values in JSX to build useful app.
  - [ ] Otherwise there would be only static content.
- [ ] In JSX this is done by using curly braces.
  - [ ] Inside curly braces you can put a variable
  - [ ] or any other JavaScript expression (something that resolves to a value: e.g. ternary
        operator is very common)
- [ ] Demonstrate an example like this:

```jsx
const name = "Jane";

root.render(
  <div>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello {name}</h1>
    <p className="intro">
      I am rendered by <strong>React</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
);
```

## React Render vs. innerHTML

Use this demo on
[ðŸ”— **CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-basics/demo-inner-html-vs-render?file=/README.md)
or locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-basics/demo-inner-html-vs-render -i
```

- [ ] Show the HTML and the `index.js` file.
  - [ ] We have the same demo implemented twice.
  - [ ] Explain that we have two `div`s.
  - [ ] The first has content created using `innerHTML` and the second has content created using
        React.
  - [ ] Every second (using `setInterval`) we increment a count variable, set `innerHTML` and call
        `render`.
- [ ] Demonstrate that template strings with HTML and JSX look a lot alike.
- [ ] Explain two main differences between JSX and `innerHTML`

  - [ ] No `$` sign in JSX
    - [ ] With template string we used the `$` sign to insert values with string interpolation.
    - [ ] JSX is not a string, so there is no interpolation.
    - [ ] The JSX syntax doesn't use the `$` sign.
  - [ ] Safe insert of dynamic data
    - [ ] With `innerHTML` we need to be cautious with string interpolation.
    - [ ] Dynamic data based on user content could include HTML tags and
          [be unsafe to use](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML#replacing_the_contents_of_an_element).
    - [ ] JSX is not a string, so there is no interpolation.
    - [ ] This potential problem doesn't exist in React.
    - [ ] React handles a safe insertion for us in the background.

## Optional deeper comparison: React Render vs. innerHTML

> ðŸ’¡ Please decide based on your experience with the class, if the following explanations are
> suitable

- [ ] Explain that calling `render` with the same JSX will not change the DOM completely.
  - [ ] In that regard it is very different from `innerHTML` which would replace the entire DOM
        tree.
- [ ] Show the full DOM is replaced every second in the `innerHTML` case. (Show the DOM tree in the
      inspector.)
  - [ ] You can make this point clearer by typing into the rendered `<textarea>`.
- [ ] Compare this to the React render case.
  - [ ] Only the count text is updated and the rest of the DOM stays the same.
  - [ ] This means that you can change the text in the `<textarea>` and it will not be replaced.
  - [ ] React is smart enough to only update the parts of the DOM that need to be updated.
  - [ ] In other words, it takes our declarative description of the DOM and efficiently updates the
        actual DOM using imperative DOM manipulation like (`element.classList.add()`,
        `element.append()`, `element.textContent =`, etc.).
  - [ ] Even though both methods are (arguably) declarative. The user experience is very different.

> ðŸ’¡ You may also point out that the React render case is more efficient. The browser does not need
> to re-parse the HTML and re-create the full DOM tree every second. It only needs to update the
> text. This is not very relevant given the size of the Demo, but can be good to know.

## How to create your own components

Open the [Render Demo](#render-demo) again and continue your demonstration.

- [ ] Explain that working with React is all about creating components.
  - [ ] Idea: a component is a part of the UI with encapsulated appearance and logic.
  - [ ] In code: a component is a function that returns JSX.
- [ ] Explain that components can be nested.
  - [ ] A component can be used inside of another component by putting them within the JSX.
  - [ ] It's like creating our own HTML tags, which represent a lot of other HTML tags.
  - [ ] Components are reuseable an can be put into JSX wherever we like.
- [ ] Explain the rules of components.
  - [ ] Function name with uppercase first letter (convention: PascalCase)
  - [ ] Returns JSX (with one root element)

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  const name = "Jane";

  return <h1 id="greeting">Hello {name}</h1>;
}

root.render(
  <div>
    <Greeting />
    <p className="intro">
      I am rendered by <strong>React</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
);
```

## The `App` component

- [ ] Explain the purpose of the `App` component.
  - [ ] Convention: a file called `App.js` with the `App` component inside.
  - [ ] It's the starting point of the React app.
- [ ] Explain the purpose of `index.js` file.
  - [ ] The `index.js` file is used to mount the React app into the HTML document.
- [ ] When creating a new React project from a template these two files are usually given.
  - [ ] You don't need to change the `index.js`.
  - [ ] You can add your own components to the JSX in `App.js`.
- [ ] In those project templates also `StrictMode` is used.
  - [ ] `StrictMode` helps writing modern React code.
  - [ ] It is a tool for finding potential bugs.
  - [ ] It shows warning messages in the JavaScript console.
- [ ] Create an `App.js` file and update your code like this:

```jsx
// index.js
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.querySelector("#root");
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

```jsx
// App.js
export default function App() {
  <div>
    <Greeting />
    <p className="intro">
      I am rendered by <strong>React</strong>
    </p>
  </div>;
}

function Greeting() {
  const name = "Jane";

  return <h1 id="greeting">Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

## The React ecosystem

- [ ] Talk about the React ecosystem.
  - [ ] There are many modern libraries or frameworks to build JavaScript apps.
  - [ ] React is just one of them, but it has the widest distribution and highest market share.
  - [ ] A big ecosystem evolved around React.
  - [ ] Many developers wrote code for React, which we can benefit from.
- [ ] Give examples for benefits.
  - [ ] We can not only write components ourself, but also use components that are written by others
    - (e.g. complex calendar or whole UI component libraries)
  - [ ] Besides components there are a many other helpful libraries
    - (e.g. for SPA routing - remember our own implementation in the Quiz-App)
  - [ ] In the upcoming React lectures we will heavily rely on code written published by other
        developers.

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](react-basics.md) and the [challenges](challenges-react-basics.md) to the
      students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

React, render, JSX, component, declarative, string interpolation, nesting

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

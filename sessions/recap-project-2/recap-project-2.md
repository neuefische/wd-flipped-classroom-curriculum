# Recap 2: Quiz App - Interactivity

In a previous project you create the layout for a Quiz App with HTML and CSS. The focus of this
project is to add interactivity with JavaScript.

## Tasks

Follow the tasks given in this
[exercise document](https://github.com/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/recap-project-2/quiz-app/README.md)

You can continue working on the code from the last Quiz App project.

## Optional starter code

If you are not yet finished or not satisfied with your code, you can use this template to start your
work.

Open your terminal and navigate to the folder all your projects are located. Execute the following
command to create a new project based on a template:

`npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/recap-project-2/quiz-app -i`

- There are three pages:
  - an `index.html` with a list of all question cards
  - a `bookmark.html` with bookmarked cards only
  - a `profile.html` with personal information and settings
- The Structure of styling follows [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/); this is why the CSS files
  are organized according to their corresponding component.

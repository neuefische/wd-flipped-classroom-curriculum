# Recap Project 2: Quiz App - Interactivity

In this project, students will add interactivity to the Quiz App.

They can either work on their own code or use the starter template as described in the [challenges files](./challenge.md).

> ðŸ’¡ This project is a continuation of [Recap Project 1](/sessions/recap-project-1).

## Note

Students are supposed to work on this project by themselves.

If you would like the students to work in groups, you need to consider teaching the Git Advanced Session before this project.

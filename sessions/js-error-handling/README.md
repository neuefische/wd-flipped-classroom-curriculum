# JS Error Handling

## Active Learning

This is an Active Learning session for the students. That means that the coach assigned to the session only needs to provide a brief 5-10 minute intro.

- [Introduce](#active-learning-intro) the topic for 5 - 10 minutes
- Share [Challenges](challenges-js-error-handling.md) and [learning document](js-error-handling.md) with the students

## Session Guide

## Learning Objectives

- knowing the **different types of exceptions**
- understanding the `try...catch` construct
- knowing how to throw **custom errors**
- understanding the errors in a `fetch` request environment

---

How can we ensure our applications handle errors gracefully and provide a better user experience? We will learn how to manage and handle errors in JavaScript effectively.

### Question

How can we use JavaScript to catch and handle errors to prevent our application from crashing?

---

### Required

- JS DOM and Events
- JS Conditions and Booleans
- JS Fetch

## Active Learning Intro

- Explain that errors are an inevitable part of programming, but with the right tools and techniques, we can effectively control how our code behaves even when facing "unexpected" issues.

- Elaborate that they'll start by understanding the **different types of errors**, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.

> A quick and easy example for e.g. a syntax error would be intentionally entering a bad line of code such as `console.log"This doesn't work.";` into your **browser console**, which will produce the error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string`

- Add that they'll explore the `try...catch` construct, which allows them to handle exceptions and prevent them from crashing our apps.

- Mention that they'll also learn how to throw **custom errors**, enabling them to create our own error messages and handle specific error conditions.

- Explain that they'll discuss error handling in the context of **asynchronous operations**, particularly in **fetch requests**, where errors can occur due to network issues or server errors.

- Conclude that by the end of this **Active Learning** session, they'll have a solid understanding of error handling techniques in JavaScript, empowering them to write **more robust and reliable code**.

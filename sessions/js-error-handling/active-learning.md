# Active Learning - JS Error Handling

Sometimes we have to drift away from the happy path, and see what happens when things do not go as planned.
You'll be presented with various types of errors and exceptions, and how to deal with them in JavaScript.
Particular emphasis will lie in handling network and `fetch` errors.

The active learning process involves the following steps:

## 1. Read the document

Read the document and try to understand the content.

## 2. Dissect the examples

The document contains a lot of examples. Try to understand what is happening in the examples. They appear as you keep scrolling down the page.

## 3. Collect questions

As you read the document, you will probably have questions. Write them down in a text file or on a piece of paper. We will have time to discuss them later during the recap time.

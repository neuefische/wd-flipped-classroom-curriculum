## Learning objectives

- [ ] Understanding the `transition` property
- [ ] Understanding easing functions
- [ ] Understanding what properties can be animated
- [ ] Understanding the `animation` property

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ğŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

Animations aren't just fun, they're also useful! CSS Animations are a powerful tool. They allow you to create apps that are more interactive and engaging, and sometimes even more accessible.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

Good animations can make a website feel more alive and can help to guide the user through the
website. They can also help to make a website more accessible.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can you improve the user experience of your website by adding animations?

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

- CSS Basics
- CSS Media Queries
- JavaScript Basics (adding classes to elements)

## Inform: Session Guide

### What is a CSS transtion?

- [ ] Explain that a CSS transtion allows you to animate a change from one value of a property to
      another (like color, opacity, scale, etc.)
- [ ] Transitions can look better than abrupt changes because they give the user a sense of
      continuity between states. This can be especially important for users with cognitive
      disabilities.
- [ ] Transition can also be overused and too extreme. They can be distracting and annoying and can
      cause motion sickness or even seizures in some people.
- [ ] Explain that you need to find a good balance for any type of animation.

### How to use a CSS `transition`

- [ ] Open the
      [demo on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-animations/demo-start?file=/css/styles.css).
      (Here is the
      [finished demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-animations/demo-end?file=/css/styles.css))

- [ ] Explain that you have to define two states for a property you want to animate like this:

```css
.box {
	background-color: lightblue;
}

.box:hover {
	background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

- [ ] Show that you can make the browser transition between these two states by adding a
      `transition` property to the box:

```css
.box {
	background-color: lightblue;
	transition: background-color 1s;
}

.box:hover {
	background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

- [ ] Open the browser developer tools and play with the duration, delay and easing function to
      explore how they work. Show built-in (`ease`, `linear`, `ease-in-out`, etc.) and custom easing
      curves. You can also show [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com) to play with easing
      curves.

- [ ] Add another property to the transition, to show that you can animate multiple properties at
      once (with different durations and easings):

```css
.box {
	background-color: lightblue;
	transition: background-color 1s, opacity 2s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
	background-color: lightcoral;
	opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Animatable properties

- [ ] Explain that not all properties can be animated. For example, `display` and `position` cannot
      be animated. You can find a list of animatable properties on
      [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties).

- [ ] Explain that some properties can have negative performance implications. For example,
      animating `width` and `height` can cause the browser to recalculate the layout of the page for
      each frame (usally 60 times per second). Tell students to avoid animating these properties.

- [ ] Show some properties that are safe and cheap to animate: `color`s, `opacity`, `transform`,
      `box-shadow` etc.

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](css-animations.md) and the [challenges](challenges-css-animations.md) to
      the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Keep student groups of the Recap Project
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ğŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

transition, animation, timing function, duration, delay, ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out,
ease-in-out, cubic-bezier

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

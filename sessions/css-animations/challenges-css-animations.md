## Quiz App project continuation

Continue to work on your Quiz App project and see where you can add some animations.

### Hover States

Add transitions to hover states in the quiz app. For example, you could add a transition to the
background color of the buttons when you hover over them.

### Bookmark Icon

If you're using a color to indicate if a question is bookmarked, add a transition to the color of
the bookmark icon in the quiz app.

### Form Field Text Counter

Make the counter output red when the user has typed too many characters into the input field.
Transition the color property of the counter.

### Bonus: Animate Creating new Cards

Use `@keyframes` and the `animation` property to animate the new questions that are added to the
quiz app.

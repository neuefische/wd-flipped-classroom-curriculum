## Session Guide

Until now, we have focused on the frontend of a web application â€” everything that happens in the browser. Today, we shift our focus to the backend. We will learn some basics of how Next.js works under the hood to understand what a server does.

> What is server-side code?

### Node.js - A JavaScript Runtime Environment

- Mention that students have mostly written JavaScript that was executed in the browser.
- Explain that the browser is a runtime environment for JavaScript:
  - A place where JavaScript code can be executed to do stuff.
  - A runtime environment comes with it's own set of APIs (e.g., browser APIs, like `window` or `document`).
- Explain that there are other runtime environments for JavaScript outside of the browser:
  - Open the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  - Explain that Node.js can be used to execute JavaScript on your computer, a micro controller or on a server (everything that is not a browser).
  - Node.js also has it's own set of APIs (like `File System` or `HTTP`).
  - Point out that students have used Node.js a lot: When they type `npm` in the terminal Node.js is used to execute JavaScript.
- Create a new file `index.js` anywhere on your computer and write a simple log message like this:

```js
console.log(1 + 3);
```

- Open your terminal and run this code with Node.js:

```sh
node index.js
```

- Demonstrate the code gets executed.
- Point out that every kind of JavaScript code could be in this file (except for browser APIs).

### Backend and Server Side Code

- Introduce students to backend and server side code by explaining this image:

- Mention that "server" can mean various different things depending on the context:
  - A bunch of hardware with cables and blinking lights in a server farm.
  - An abstract concept of something to serve information on a network.
- In our current context:

  - A process that runs on a computer (our computer / a computer provided by vercel after deployment).
  - The process _listens_ for requests and can send responses.
  - The listen is tight to a specific port.
  - Imagine telephone numbers inside of a big company.
    - The base number is the hostname (domain or ip address) (`localhost` is always your own computer).
    - The extension at the end let's you talk to a specific person. The port is the extension at the end that lets you talk to a specific process, that listens on this port.
    - `localhost:8000` => ports like 8000, 8080, 3000, 3001 or 3002 are often used for local dev servers.

### Creating a Simple HTTP Server with Node.js

- Explain that we are now going to write a simple HTTP server (web-server) with Node.js to demonstrate that it's just a running process executing our JavaScript code.

- Open the empty `server.js` file in the demo and explain that we are going to define our server inside of this file.

- Explain that we first need to import the `createServer` function from the Node.js `http` package:

  - Point out this package is an API provided by Node.js and that we don't need to explicitly install it.
  - It's JavaScript that can be executed with Node.js, but not with the browser (like `window` can be used in the browser, but not with Node.js).

  ```js
  import { createServer } from "node:http";
  ```

- Explain that we can create a server with a callback function that gets called with each request to the server.
- Explain that the callback receives two parameters:

  - `request`: An object having information about the request send by the client / the browser.
  - `response`: An object providing functions to formulate the answer to this request.

  ```js
  const server = createServer((request, response) => {
    // â€¦ write response
  });
  ```

- Explain that we can formulate the response inside the callback function:

  - With the `statusCode` property we can set the status code of the response (200 is the HTTP code for "Ok").
  - With the `end()` method we can say the response is complete (it should be sent) an provide the content to send back to the client.

  ```js
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.end("Hello World");
  ```

- Explain the server is defined, but not running yet.
- Explain that we will be starting the server from the `index.js` file.
- To do so we need to export the server from the `server.js` file.

  ```js
  export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Hello World");
  });
  ```

- Explain that we can import the server in the `index.js` file:

  ```js
  import { server } from "./server.js";
  ```

- Explain that we can start the server with the `listen()` method, that takes the port as an argument:

  ```js
  import { server } from "./server.js";

  const port = 8000;
  server.listen(port);
  ```

- We can pass a callback function that get's called when the server is running. This is useful to log a message to the terminal.

  ```js
  server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
  });
  ```

- The complete example should look like this:

  ```js
  // server.js
  import { createServer } from "node:http";

  export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Hello World");
  });
  ```

  ```js
  // index.js
  import { server } from "./server.js";

  const port = 8000;
  server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
  });
  ```

  > ðŸ’¡ The reason why we're using one file for defining the server (`server.js`) and one file for starting the server (`index.js`) is that we can use the server definition in other files as well. For example to write tests for the server.

- Start the server from your terminal: `npm run start`.

  > ðŸ’¡ The `npm run dev` script will use the Node.js `--watch` mode. At the time of writing this it is still considered experimental. It requires Node.js `>18.11` but will fallback to normally starting the server if the feature is not available.
  >
  > The `--watch` mode will restart the server when you change the code.
  >
  > If you don't want to use it you can instead use `npm run start`. If you don't use it you need to restart the server manually after each change. This guide will not remind you to do so.

- Explain that we see our log message in the terminal after the server started: `Server running at http://localhost:8000/`.
- Open this address in the browser and demonstrate that we see the response: "Hello World".

### Working with the `request` Object

- Mention again that the `request` object gives us information about each individual request.
- Explain that we like to read the requested address from `request.url`.
- Change the example to look like this:

```js
export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
  if (request.url === "/hello") {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Hello World");
  } else if (request.url === "/bye") {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Bye World");
  }
});
```

- Open `http://localhost:8000/hello` and `http://localhost:8000/bye` in the browser and demonstrate the response.

### Sending a "Not Found" Response

- Explain that we need to send a response for all requests.
- Create an `else` branch and send a "Not Found" response.
- Use the `response.statusCode` to set the status code of the response to `404` which is the HTTP code for "Not Found":

  ```js
  else {
    response.statusCode = 404;
    response.end("Not Found");
  }
  ```

## Fix the errors in a Survey App

When you open
[this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-basics/survey-error-fixing?file=/js/index.js)
you will find a rough draft implementation of a Survey App. The developer made some errors and the
app has some bugs. Can you fix all errors in the JavaScript Code?

**Hint**: There is no need to change the HTML and CSS Code.

## Quiz App interactivity

Your Quiz App project contains various buttons, which are not connected to functionality yet. Let's
add some interactivity!

This challenge only concerns the first question card in your Quiz App. We'll deal with the other
question cards later. (Remember: `querySelector()` returns only the first element matching the given
selector).

Please add these mechanics to your Quiz App:

- Clicking on the "bookmark" button should toggle the button's visual state from being inactive to
  active and vice versa. (The card should not yet be displayed on the "Bookmarks" page)
- Clicking on the button labeled "Show Answer" should make the answer text visible, which was hidden
  before. Another click should hide the answer text again.

[Only for active learning sessions]

> This is an active learning session, this means that the session should take up to 5-10 minutes. The session is meant as an introduction into the topic, most concepts will be learned independently by the students with the help of the active learning material.

[Introduce the topic by explaining its relevance and importance, possibly through a common problem or challenge. Activate prior knowledge by connecting the topic to concepts the students have already learned.]

> [Pose a question or discussion prompt that encourages students to think critically about the topic and its application.]

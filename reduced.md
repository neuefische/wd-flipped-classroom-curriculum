# Reduced Curriculum

This is the session overview for the reduced curriculum. It follows a slightly different order than the current curriculum. Sessions are removed, merged, simplified or changed to be active learning sessions (without a coach).

If a course is started with this curriculum, it should be finished with this curriculum. Do not switch to the current curriculum in the middle of a course as the two versions might not be compatible.

> Status:  
> 👷‍♀️ **In Progress** — _please do not start a new cohort with this curriculum yet_.
>
> @Maintainers:
>
> - Each PR that changes the reduced curriculum should also update this document. (In addition to the changelog.)
> - Once the reduced curriculum is ready, this status should be changed to **Ready** so that it can be used for new cohorts.
> - Once we do not have any cohorts running with the current curriculum, we can remove the current curriculum and move these contents to `README.md`.
> - Sessions that are changed for the reduced curriculum should have the postfix `-new` in their folder name (copy the original folder). Once the reduced curriculum is ready, we can remove the old sessions and rename the new sessions to remove the `-new` postfix.
> - Removing a session can be done by simply removing it from this list. We can then remove the session folder once the reduced curriculum takes over.
> - This workflow does not require us to use any branches while sill using both versions in parallel and thus hopefully prevent some merging headaches.
> - The plan for what to do can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFmkxw_98LMAgCDjhUr4jwrnZ2MGpYCeBf9KSHbP314/edit#gid=1870391809).

## Sessions

Sessions are structured not by week - but by days. It does not matter which session is being held on
which day of the week. This is the recommended order of sessions. Morning sessions should be the
ones more challenging than afternoon sessions.

> Day numbers removed for now to make editing this simpler. We can add them back later. ~Jan

## Daily routine

We have a target of 540 teaching minutes (= 9 hours or 12 teaching units (45 min)) per day.

### Thursday

Thursday afternoons are reserved for "autonomous learning" (or "peer learning", which we did not discuss yet). Students have time to repeat and research whatever topics they need to. They can organize themselves in groups, if they like. During "autonomous learning", the students just repeat, no new content is taught.

| duration | teaching minutes | time          | content                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5:00     | 300              | 14:00 - 19:00 | Autonomous Learning |

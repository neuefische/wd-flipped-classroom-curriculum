# Welcome to the Curriculum of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp!

This is the curriculum of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp.

## Sessions

The curriculum is divided into sessions, each being a distinct teaching unit focused on a specific topic. Each day includes two session slots. Sessions vary between standard sessions following the [usual schedule](#daily-routine), [Active Learning](#active-learning) sessions, and [Self-directed Learning](#thursday-afternoons-self-directed-learning) sessions.

Sessions marked with a 🏗️ are incomplete.

### Upcoming Session Timetable

This timetable includes the new 4-day **React Recap Project** (Recap Project 4) and predefined capstone projects. The previous timetable is available [here](https://github.com/neuefische/web-curriculum/blob/fff449f49da7aa3b916edbf2cdaf1b65908fad60/README.md).

### Thursday Afternoons: Self-Directed Learning

On Thursday afternoons, students engage in **Self-directed Learning**, focusing on topics of their choice in groups or individually, without new content being introduced.

| Duration | Teaching Minutes | Time          | Content                |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2:45     | 0                | 14:00 - 16:45 | Self-directed Learning |
| 0:30     | 30               | 16:45 - 17:15 | Recap with Coach       |

During the recap, students are given one minute each to speak about their research, learnings, and any gaps.

### Active Learning

**Active Learning** sessions represent a novel teaching approach within our cohorts.
Students are given an interactive handout that replaces in-person lectures. These handouts can be found [here](https://web-active-learning.vercel.app/), and the corresponding repository is available [here](https://github.com/neuefische/web-active-learning). The interactive handout is linked in the challenge file of the respective session as the "Active Learning" challenge.

### Workshops

We use `marp` for creating slides in the neuefische design, available in the [`workshops` folder](/workshops).

## Daily Routine

We have a target of 540 teaching minutes per day, which is equivalent to 9 hours or 12 teaching units of 45 minutes each.

| Duration | Teaching Minutes | Time          | Content                  |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0:30     | 30               | 9:00 - 9:30   | Student Recap            |

## How to Contribute

Changes to the curriculum are managed through tickets on the [Curriuclum Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/projects/45/views/10).

### When to Create a Ticket

Use this board for significant curriculum changes. For minor fixes like bugs or broken links, make direct updates.

### Proposing Changes

To propose a change:

1. Click `+ Add item` in the "🆕 New" column of the [Curriculum Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/projects/45/views/10).
2. Enter `#web-curriculum` and choose `Create new issue` from the dropdown menu.
3. In the popup window, select the `New Ticket` issue template.
4. Detail the issue and your solution, then create the ticket.
5. Share your suggestion and ticket link in the `#web-curriculum` Slack channel. The Curriculum Team will manage the process and update you on its status.

### Creating New Sessions

To develop a new session:

1. Outline the topic of the new session.
2. Collaborate with coaches to decide on teaching methods.
3. Create a new branch for the session:

```shell
git switch -c my-awesome-session
```

4. Generate a session folder using the session template:

```shell
npm run create-session
```

5. Document the meeting's conclusions in the `README.md` using bullet points.
6. Push the new branch to GitHub.

## Our Goals

> 💡 **Self-sufficient learning** to prepare the students for their learning path and entry into
> their professional life.

> 💡 **Active and problem-based learning** to offer a practical approach of learning according to
> [research](https://teaching.cornell.edu/teaching-resources/engaging-students/problem-based-learning).

> 💡 **Integration of a "safety net" / "backup"** to make sure the students are following along with
> the content of the course.

> 💡 **Balanced coders** to actively make time to process the content, this is to increase
> motivation, productivity and focus for the students.

> 💡 **Guest lectures for a broad skill-set** to teach a broad collection of soft- and hard-skills
> that teach methodological approaches useful for the daily professional life.

> 💡 **Balanced coaches** to give more space for coaches to advance their personal development or
> contribute to in-house projects.

# Welcome to the Curriculum of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp!

This is the curriculum of the neuefische Web Development bootcamp.

## Changelog

In this [changelog](https://github.com/neuefische/web-curriculum/blob/main/changelog.md) we collect all current changes that are made to the curriculum. 

## Sessions

Sessions are structured not by week - but by days. It does not matter which session is being held on
which day of the week. This is the recommended order of sessions. Morning sessions should be the
ones more challenging than afternoon sessions.

| Day | Session                                                                         |

## Daily routine

We have a target of 540 teaching minutes (= 9 hours or 12 teaching units (45 min)) per day.

## Workshops

We use `marp` to create slides for workshops which feature the neuefische design.

You can find all slides as well as a description how to use them [in the `workshops` folder](/workshops).

## How to contribute

There are always tasks to be done to constantly improve the curriculum. Have a look at the [Curriculum Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/projects/45/views/10) to see what tasks can be worked on.

If you have ideas how to improve the curriculum, check which of the following 3 categories the update fits in and take the respective action:

### Patch

**Examples**:

- very small changes like bug fixes, typos, migration of demos / challenges from codesandbox to web-exercises
- does not introduce new content, only improves already existing parts

**Action**:

- implement the fix / improvement immediately
- create a PR and double check the content
- a code review is not mandatory

### Minor Change

**Examples**:

- introduction of new content without deleting or altering existing content
- redistribution of already existing content into different sessions
- introduction of new challenges

**Action**:

- open an issue in the [curriculum project board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/projects/45/views/10) and describe the proposed change
- share the issue in the web-curriculum slack channel
- after discussing feedback with other coaches, move the issue into the "ready to work on" column
- the proposal can be implemented

### Major Change

**Examples**:

- introduction of "breaking changes" which alter the curriculum content substantially
- rewrite of an entire session
- swapping central technologies / concepts of a sessions, e.g. reactQuery instead of useSWR
- General layout changes of curriculum files

**Action**:

- open an issue in the [curriculum project board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/projects/45/views/10) and describe the proposed change
- share the issue in the web-curriculum slack channel
- discuss the proposal in the headless or headful weekly meetings
- after the pool coaches come to an agreement about the proposal move the issue into the "ready to work on" column
- the proposal can be implemented

## Teaching custom versions of a session

We generally encourage each coach to find their own teaching style which might include

- using a custom demo
- explaining the content of a session differently as suggested by the session guide.  
  But before using a custom session each coach should answer the following question:
  > Can the planned changes impose major difficulties for other coaches in the future?

These difficulties might arise because

- Other coaches are unfamiliar with tools that are planned to be taught
- Coaches cannot help students with custom challenges
- Students have not learned a concept / tool that another session relies on

The changes to a session need to avoid these issues. As long as this is the case, a coach is more than welcome to use their custom version. They might inform the pool about the changes if necessary (see "Handling deviations from the curriculum").

If your planned session does not satisfy this criteria but you are convinced that it would be an improvement to the session, you are highly encouraged to open up a minor / major change issue to implement the idea and share it with the whole team.

## Handling deviations from the curriculum

Deviations to a curriculum can occur either:

- because some parts of a session had to be left out
- because the coach taught their custom version of the session.

The pool needs to be updated about changes that influence other sessions. The way we keep track of these changes will be announced shortly.

## Creating new sessions

If you want to introduce a new session to the curriculum you can follow these steps:

1. Describe the new topic of the session.
2. Discuss with a group of coaches how we want to teach the topic.
3. Create a new branch for the session:

```
git switch -c my-awesome-session
```

4. Create a new session folder based on the session template. Use this script to do this:

```
npm run create-session
```

5. Add the results of the meeting to the README.md in bullet form.
6. Push the new branch to GitHub
7. Move the ticket to "Read to work" in the board.

## Our goals are:

> ðŸ’¡ **Self-sufficient learning** to prepare the students for their learning path and entry into
> their professional life

> ðŸ’¡ **Active and problem-based learning** to offer a practical approach of learning according to
> [research](https://teaching.cornell.edu/teaching-resources/engaging-students/problem-based-learning)

> ðŸ’¡ **Integration of a "safety net"/"backup"** to make sure the students are following along with
> the content of the course

> ðŸ’¡ **Balanced coders** to actively make time to process the content, this is to increase
> motivation, productivity and focus for the students

> ðŸ’¡ **Guest lectures for a broad skill-set** to teach a broad collection of soft- and hard-skills
> that teach methodological approaches useful for the daily professional life

> ðŸ’¡ **Balanced coaches** to give more space for coaches to advance their personal development or
> contribute to in-house projects

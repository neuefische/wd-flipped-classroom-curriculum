# Welcome to the new curriculum!
This is the working progress of the new curriculum of the bootcamp Web Development. <br>
This update is aiming to improve the way our students learn. <br>
#### Our goals are:


> ðŸ’¡ Self-sufficient learning <br>
> to prepare the students for their learning path and entry into their professional life

> ðŸ’¡ Active and problem based learning <br>
> to offer a practical approach of learning according to [research](https://teaching.cornell.edu/teaching-resources/engaging-students/problem-based-learning)

> ðŸ’¡ Integration of a "safety net"/"backup" <br>
> to make sure the students are following along with the content of the course 

> ðŸ’¡ Balanced coders 
> to actively make time to process the content, this is to increase motivation, productivity and focus for the students

> ðŸ’¡ Guest lectures for a broad skillset
> to teach a broad collection of soft- and hardskills that teach methodological approaches useful for the daily professional life

> ðŸ’¡ Balanced coaches
> to give more space for coaches to advance their personal development or contribute to in-house projects

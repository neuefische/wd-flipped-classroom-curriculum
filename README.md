# Welcome to the new curriculum!

This is the working progress of the new curriculum of the bootcamp Web Development. <br>
This update is aiming to improve the way our students learn. <br>

#### Our goals are:

> ðŸ’¡ Self-sufficient learning <br>
> to prepare the students for their learning path and entry into their professional life

> ðŸ’¡ Active and problem-based learning <br>
> to offer a practical approach of learning according to [research](https://teaching.cornell.edu/teaching-resources/engaging-students/problem-based-learning)

> ðŸ’¡ Integration of a "safety net"/"backup" <br>
> to make sure the students are following along with the content of the course

> ðŸ’¡ Balanced coders
> to actively make time to process the content, this is to increase motivation, productivity and focus for the students

> ðŸ’¡ Guest lectures for a broad skillset
> to teach a broad collection of soft- and hardskills that teach methodological approaches useful for the daily professional life

> ðŸ’¡ Balanced coaches
> to give more space for coaches to advance their personal development or contribute to in-house projects

## Sessions

Sessions are structured not by week - but by days. It does not matter anymore which session is being held on which day of the week. This is the recommended order of sessions.
Morning sessions should be the ones more challenging than afternoon sessions.

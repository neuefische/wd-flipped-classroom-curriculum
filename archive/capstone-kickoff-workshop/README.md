## Session Guide

In this workshop, the students are split into groups with 3-4 people each to sketch out capstone project ideas. Give the following introduction to the capstone as a starting point for them.

### Capstone Project Ideas

- [ ] Tell the students, that they will develop possible capstone ideas in this workshop.
- [ ] Highlight, that the final groups for each project will be created at a later point, so they must not decide yet which project they want to join.
- [ ] Mention, that the plan is to use some of the project ideas they develop today as the basis for the real capstone projects, but that the ideas might be adjusted later by the course management.

### Workshop Roadmap

Explain the structure of the workshop to the students:

- [ ] They will work in groups of 3-4 people.
- [ ] Each group needs to develop at least 2 project ideas.
- [ ] Suggest, that each group should first brainstorm about possible ideas (max 15min.) and then decide on 2-3 ideas they want to develop further.
- [ ] They will present their ideas to the class at the end of the workshop.

### Project Examples

Explain to the students what a good project idea looks like

- [ ] The project doesn't need to be innovative, but should be useful for applying the already learned knowledge.
- [ ] The project should cover the typical data operations create, read, update and delete (since the students haven't heard about CRUD yet, just mention the different ways to interact with data.)
- [ ] Games as project ideas can be risky, since a half finished game is not really useful.

### Prepare the Group Phase

- [ ] Group the students into groups of 3-4 people.
- [ ] Highlight, that these are **not** the capstone groups.
- [ ] Upload the [handout](./capstone-kickoff-workshop.md) and [challenges](./challenges-capstone-kickoff-workshop.md).
- [ ] Create a thread for collecting the project ideas. You can use the following template:
  ```
  üöÄ Capstone Project Ideas üöÄ
  ```
- [ ] Explain that they should create 1 post in this thread for each idea they want to present. Each post must include:
  - A filled out project template.
  - A link to a excalidraw collaboration room with the wireframes for the project (see project template).
    > üí° You can show the students that the handout of this session includes an example project idea.

Create an example project idea post in the thread with the following steps:

- [ ] Open the [project template](./assets/capstone-idea-template.md). Copy it in a temporary file and add some example content.
- [ ] Show the students how to create an `excalidraw collaboration session`:
  - [ ] Open [excalidraw](https://www.excalidraw.com).
  - [ ] Click the `group button` in the top right corner.
  - [ ] Explain that only these session links including `#room=...` create separate excalidraw instances and we will need those for the presentations.
    > üí° these excalidraw rooms can be opened side by side and won't overwrite your current excalidraw board. In contrast, so called "sharable links" of excaldraw sketches including `#json=...` will overwrite the current drawing in your excalidraw board.
- [ ] Replace the dummy exalidraw link with the just created excalidraw collaboration session.
- [ ] Paste the filled out version of the template as an example into the idea thread.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Please note that this structure is important for the course management. It reduces the necessary steps to collect and prepare the ideas drastically.

### Project Idea Presentations

- [ ] After the workshop time, let the students present their capstone ideas.
  > ‚ùóÔ∏è Make sure to plan in enough time for the presentations. Depending on the number of groups, this might take up to an hour.
- [ ] Review the ideas and give feedback. You can focus on the following criteria:
  - Project scope: is it too complex or too basic?
  - Are all basic data operations (read, create, update, delete) included in the App?
  - Is the list of main features condensed enough or does the App need a lot of features in order to be functional?
  - Data Source: Relies the App on data from a foreign API? Is the API accessible for the students / working properly?

### Preparing the Project Ideas

- [ ] Collect the capstone ideas and share the link to the Project Ideas Thread with the course management in the cohort internal slack channel.
- [ ] The course management will prepare the capstone ideas for the students to vote for their preferred projects.

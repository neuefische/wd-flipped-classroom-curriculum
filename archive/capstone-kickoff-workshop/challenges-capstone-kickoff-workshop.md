# Challenges: Capstone Kickoff Workshop

## Capstone Project Ideas

Create at least 2 capstone project ideas. For each idea,

- Use the [template](./assets/capstone-idea-template.md) to structure the project functionalities.
- Create an excalidraw collaboration session by opening up [excalidraw](https://www.excalidraw.com) and clicking the group icon in the top right corner.

**1. Brainstorm:**

- In your assigned groups, consider possible ideas for a Capstone Project.
- Select realistic and feasible projects that could add value for users.
- Don't spend more than 15 min for brainstroming. The goal is to generate as many project ideas as possible.
- Afterwards, decide on 2-3 ideas you want to develop further.

Perform steps 2 and 3 for each project idea separately:

**2. Discussion of Functionalities and Features:**

- Think about specific functionalities and features for your ideas. What added value does your app offer? What challenges could it solve?
- Copy the [template](./assets/capstone-idea-template.md).
- Fill out the template and split your features into main features and your nice-to-have features.
  > ðŸ’¡ Main features represent the core functionality of the app that makes it a useful productivity tool. Nice-to-have features are extensions that can increase the convenience and value of the app for the user, but are not necessarily required for the basic functionality.

**3. Create Wireframes:**

- Open the excalidraw collaboration session.
- Sketch initial simple wireframes of your app ideas. These should represent the most important views of your app and clarify the navigation for the user. This should not be an elaborate design. Rather, it is about the design logic (UX).
- Add the link to the collaboration session in the project idea template.

**4. Presentation:**

Each group will be asked to present their capstone project ideas, functionalities and wireframes to the course in a short presentation (5 - 10 minutes).

- Post your filled out project idea templates in the project ideas thread.
- Explain the topic of the app in one or two short sentences. Quickly summarize the main and nice-to-have features.

### Helpful questions for brainstorming

- What daily challenges could be made easier by an app?
- Are there apps that you miss or that you would improve?
- How can you creatively develop existing solutions?

### Tips for your wireframes:

- Focus on structure and flow, less on detailed design
- Think about how users can intuitively navigate through the app
- Use tools like excalidraw

### Finally

Take this opportunity to be creative and put your acquired knowledge to practical use. We are eager to hear your ideas and look forward to the exciting projects that will be created in the coming weeks.

**Good luck and have fun! âœ¨**

# Self Directed Learning 1

This session is dedicated to self-directed learning. This means the students can decide freely which topics they want to recap and practice.

## GitHub Discussions Board

During the self-directed learning time the students should ask their questions on our discussions board. We also have a category for self-directed learning. The students can use this category to ask questions and help each other. The coaches will also be available on the discussions board to answer questions.

Therefore, you need to introduce the board to the students and explain how to use it:

- Show them where to find the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning)
- Show them how to create a new topic
- Show them how to reply to a topic
- Show them how to mark a reply as the solution
- Show them where they can find a [guide on how to use the discussions board during self-directed learning](https://github.com/neuefische/questions/wiki)

## Material for Students

Some students find it helpful to have some guidance and suggestions on what to do. Therefore we provide **optional** challenges that the students can work on.

Feel free to add more options according to the needs of your students.
For example:

- Create a link to the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning) for questions that can be added by the students.
- Create a link to [the guides on how to ask good questions in our discussions board](https://github.com/neuefische/questions/wiki).
- Add a link to helpful video that you recommend.
- Add a link to an article that concludes a difficult topic of the week.

# Pair Programming with ChatGPT! 🚀

> 💡 "AI won't replace programmers, but programmers who use AI will!"

## Supercharge Your Coding Practice with AI

**AI can make you 10x faster!** ⚡

To land a position as a software engineer, passing the coding interview is crucial. Most people fail their first few interviews and only succeed after deliberate, frequent practice. **Consistency is KEY!** 🗝️

So, how can you practice coding tasks and problem-solving effectively? Luckily, AI tools like ChatGPT can be your personal coach and pair programming buddy throughout your journey! 🤖

> ❗️ We will have more sessions on how to tackle technical interviews soon! Stay tuned!

## How to Utilize ChatGPT as a Personal Coach in Pair Programming

If you want ChatGPT to give you the correct answers, you should learn how to ask the _right questions_, a skill known as _prompting_!

## Here are some tips to help you craft effective prompts:

### 1. Define Specific Goals 🎯

Clearly define what you want to achieve in your pair programming session. For example, you might want to count all the occurring characters in a string.

**Example:**

> "I want to solve the character count problem where I count all the occurring characters in a string in JavaScript."

### 2. Provide Context 📝

Give ChatGPT the necessary background information. Include the problem statement, relevant code snippets, and any initial thoughts or approaches you’ve considered.

**Example:**

> "I’m working on a problem where I need to count all the occurring characters in a string. For example, if the input string is 'aba', the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. If the string is empty, the result should be an empty object literal, {}."

### 3. Assign Roles 🎭

Assign ChatGPT a specific role that fits the context of your task. This helps the AI tailor its responses to your needs.

**Example:**

> "Act as a senior JavaScript developer guiding a junior developer through solving a coding problem."

### 4. Request Step-by-Step Guidance 🧩

Ask for detailed, step-by-step instructions to help you understand the problem and the solution. This approach can help you learn the underlying concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.

**Example:**

> "Can you explain the approach to solve the problem and help me understand each step, without providing any code? I want to try and solve it on my own."

### 5. Set Constraints and Provide Examples 🚧

Set any necessary constraints or guidelines for the solution, and provide examples of inputs and expected outputs. This will help ChatGPT generate responses that are more aligned with your requirements.

**Example:**

> "The solution should handle all edge cases, such as an empty string. For example, for the input 'aba', the function should return {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. For an empty string, it should return {}."

## Example Prompt

Here’s a complete example prompt incorporating these elements for a JavaScript developer working on the character count problem:

---

**Prompt:**

> "I’m a junior JavaScript developer preparing for coding interviews and want to practice pair programming with you where you play the role of an expert JavaScript developer and coach. Currently, I’m working on a problem with the following description:
> 'The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. What if the string is empty? Then the result should be an empty object literal, {}.' Can you please explain the steps I should take to understand the problem, break it down, and solve it? Provide the approach in plain English steps, and help me understand each step? Please don't provide me with the code because I want to try and solve it on my own."

---

That starts the discussion between you and your personal expert JavaScript coach! Just like in real chats and discussions, you would have follow-up questions as you progress in the discussion.

> ❗️ Make sure to utilize the follow-up questions to understand the problem! Never copy and past code blindly from ChatGPT - you don't want to end up like this guy! 👇🤭

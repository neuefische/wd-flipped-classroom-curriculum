## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- Modern software is often very complex and complexity increases over time
- We as software developers want to ensure that our software works as it should be
  - We want to reduce the amount of bugs (especially the big/critical bugs)
- In order to find bugs, we need to test our software
  - Manual testing by clicking buttons in the UI can be a very time consuming, tedious and
    unreliable process
- Therefore, we are well advised to use tools that allow to test automatically

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

- Automated testing provides confidence
  - We can run all tests automatically with every change to the code (e.g. before merging a pull
    request)
  - Everything that worked before the change, still works
- This is very important for software companies
  - Users have rising expectations regarding the quality of a software
  - Software companies need to ensure a certain level of quality

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can we be sure that a function works exactly as intended?

### Different types of tests

- [ ] Explain that there are different types of test automation
- [ ] Show the
      [Testing Trophy](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications)
- [ ] Explain the `four types` of tests
  - [ ] `Static` Tests
    - [ ] We discussed this topic already in the previous session about `Linting`
    - [ ] The code is read automatically to find typos (think of a spellchecker)
  - [ ] `Unit` Tests
    - [ ] The code is not only read, but executed
    - [ ] Tests the actual logic that is written in code
    - [ ] A single function
    - [ ] No dependencies
    - [ ] The focus of this lecture
  - [ ] `Integration` Tests
    - [ ] Multiple units working together
  - [ ] `End to End` Tests
    - [ ] Tests a complete flow of data through all parts of the application
    - [ ] Like clicking through the UI, but not manually by a person

### Testability of a function (pure functions)

- [ ] Open the `greet.js` file
  - [ ] Explain the `greet` function
- [ ] Point out that this function is easy to test because it is a `pure function`
  - [ ] It produces the same result every time it's called with the same arguments
  - [ ] It has a `return` statement
  - [ ] It has `no external dependencies`
    - [ ] Everything is passed via arguments (e.g. no usage of variables outside of function scope)
  - [ ] There are `no side effects`
    - [ ] Like writing to the DOM or fetching data

### Introduction to jest

- [ ] Show the [jest website](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ ] Explain that `jest` is a testing framework for JavaScript code
  - [ ] it loads and runs all tests
  - [ ] it shows the test results (successful or failed)

### Writing a unit test

- [ ] Point out that the `greet` function is `exported`
- [ ] Create the `greet.test.js` file
  - [ ] Show that the code to be tested needs to be `imported`
  - [ ] Write and explain the `test()` function
    - [ ] 1. Argument: a description of the test in natural language
    - [ ] 2. Argument: a callback function including the test
  - [ ] Call the imported `greet` function
    - [ ] Point out that the result of this call is stored in a variable
  - [ ] Write and explain the `expect()` function
    - [ ] Allows you to test the result against certain criteria
    - [ ] Work by calling a `matcher` function
  - [ ] Write and explain the `matcher` used: `toBe()`
    - [ ] Compares two values for strict equality
    - [ ] Mention that there are various other matchers

```js
import { greet } from "./greet.js";

test("returns 'Hello Jane!' if called greet('Jane')", () => {
  const result = greet("Jane");
  expect(result).toBe("Hello Jane!");
});
```

### Running tests

- [ ] Open the `package.json` file
  - [ ] Show the line with the `test` script
  - [ ] Explain that this calls `jest`
  - [ ] Explain that it starts `jest` in watch mode (test re-run on file change)
- [ ] Execute `npm run test` in the terminal
  - [ ] Show that the result is `green` - a successful test
- [ ] Change something in the implementation in `greet.js` (e.g. `"Hi"` instead of `"Hello"`)
- [ ] Run the test again: `npm run test`
  - [ ] Show that the result is `red` - a failed test
  - [ ] The code doesn't work as described in the test
- [ ] Fix the implementation and run the test again

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

- [ ] Point out that tests _specify what_ the code should do
- [ ] Explain the mental model of `writing the test first`
  - [ ] Start your work by asking yourself: What should this code do?
  - [ ] Often this is given as `acceptance criteria`
  - [ ] Write down this criteria in form of tests
  - [ ] Afterwards start writing the code that _provides how_ to solve this requirement
- [ ] This approach is called `Test Driven Development (TDD)`

Now show how TDD looks in practice. For that, we are going to extend the greet function.

- [ ] State the following acceptance criteria
  - [ ] When the function is called without a name, it should return `"Hello stranger!"`
  - [ ] When the function is called with `<YOUR-NAME>`, it should return `"Hello coach!"`
- [ ] Open `greet.test.js` and write the tests for the acceptance criteria

  ```js
  test("returns 'Hello stranger!' if called greet()", () => {
    const result = greet();
    expect(result).toBe("Hello stranger!");
  });

  test("returns 'Hello coach!' if called greet('<YOUR-NAME>')", () => {
    const result = greet("<YOUR-NAME>");
    expect(result).toBe("Hello coach!");
  });
  ```

- [ ] Run `npm run test` in the terminal
  - [ ] Point out that the two new tests fail
  - [ ] Now we need to write the implementation
- [ ] Open `greet.js`
  - [ ] Implement the logic to meet the first acceptance criteria
    ```js
    function greet(name = "stranger") {
      return `Hello ${name}!`;
    }
    ```
- [ ] Highlight that all tests were executed after saving the file
  - [ ] Show that the second test is now successful
  - [ ] The third test still failed
- [ ] Implement the logic for the second acceptance criteria and show the result in the terminal

  ```js
  function greet(name = "stranger") {
    if (name === "<YOUR NAME>") {
      return "Hello coach!";
    }

    return `Hello ${name}!`;
  }
  ```

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](js-unit-testing.md) and the [challenges](challenges-js-unit-testing.md)
      to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

unit testing, jest, test, expect, matcher

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.

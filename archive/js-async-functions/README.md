## Learning objectives

- Understanding how asynchronous code works
- Working with promises
- Using the `async` and `await` keywords

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

In JavaScript, some code is asynchronous and takes some time to complete. We need a method to be
notified once a long running task is complete.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

Asynchronous code is very important for making network requests (using `fetch()`) which will be the
topic of the next session.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How do we handle asynchronous code and long running processes?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

- JS Functions
- JS Callback Functions
- CSS Animations

---

## Inform: Session Guide

There are three demos for this session:

Intro Blocking Demo:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/blocking-demo
```

Main Demo Start:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/demo-start
```

Main Demo End:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/demo-end
```

Fetch Demo:

```
npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/fetch-demo
```

### Introduction: JS is a single-threaded language

- [ ] Use this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

```

npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/blocking-demo
```

- [ ] Explain that some processes in programming languages take time to complete. For example,
      fetching data from a server, or doing a lot of calculations, or waiting for animations to
      complete.
- [ ] Explain that as a simple example, we will use a function that does nothing for five seconds.
- [ ] Show that the `blockMainThreadFor5Seconds()` function takes 5 seconds to be finished, but
      does nothing else (than blocking the main thread).
- [ ] `blockMainThreadFor5Seconds()` is called when clicking the button; start and end of blocking
      is written into the console.
- [ ] Note that `console.log('done blocking');` and `blockButton.removeAttribute('disabled');` are
      called after 5 seconds (when `blockMainThreadFor5Seconds()` is done executing).
- [ ] Show that you cannot input any string during these 5 seconds after hitting the button.

> ðŸ’¡ The `setTimeout()` in `blockMainThreadFor5Seconds` is only used to allow the browser to flush
> the focus and the disabled button state before the blocking starts.

- [ ] Explain the reasons for this behaviour:

- [ ] JavaScript is a single-threaded language: only one thing can happen at a time.
- [ ] Blocking the main thread

  - [ ] means that no other JavaScript code can be executed.
  - [ ] is bad because it prevents the user from interacting with the page.

- [ ] Mention the solution:
- [ ] Code that takes some time to complete can be made asynchronous.
- [ ] This means that while something that takes time is happening in the background, the main
      thread is free to execute other code.
- [ ] Technically this is done similar to how events are handled in JavaScript: the main thread
      registers a callback function that is called when the asynchronous operation is complete.
- [ ] Examples: network requests, file system access, animations, things that need to wait for
      user permission (think "Website XYZ wants to send Notifications") and timers.

> ðŸ’¡ Some things like heavy calculations that take time to complete, but actually do stuff on the
> main thread, cannot be made asynchronous.

### Asynchronous Functions: `animateBall()`

> ðŸ’¡ This session uses the Web Animation API. It can be used to animate styles just like with
> `@keyframes` and `animation` in CSS.
>
> Even though it is used as an example it is _not_ the point of this session to teach how to use the
> Web Animation API. We use it only for the reason that it is a good example for an asynchronous
> operation that intuitively takes time to complete but is much simpler than the fetch API.
>
> As a refresher on how to use the Web Animation API, see
> [Using the Web Animation API on mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API).
>
> The `.animate()` method returns an object with a `finished` property that is a `Promise` that
> resolves when the animation is complete.
>
> **The demo uses an `animateBall()` function which abstracts away the details of the Web Animation
> API and directly returns a `Promise` that resolves when the animation is complete.**

#### Simultaneous Animations

- [ ] Use this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

```

npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/demo-start
```

You can check out the final version of this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

```

npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/demo-end
```

- [ ] This demo uses the
      [`Element.animate()` browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animate) inside the `animateBall()` function.
- [ ] There are four balls: `soccer`, `basketball`, `football` and `tennis`.
- [ ] When clicking the `animateButton`,

  - [ ] the button is disabled
  - [ ] all four balls start their animation via `animateBall()`
  - [ ] the button is enabled

- [ ] Click the `Animate` button and explain the problem:
- [ ] All balls start and finish at the same time, but we want them to start one after another.
- [ ] Also the button is enabled before the animations are finished.

#### Staggered Animations with `promise.then()`

- [ ] To start one after another, we need to know when the animation is finished.
- [ ] `animateBall()` returns a `Promise` object:
- [ ] store the return value in a variable and log it to the console
- [ ] inside the console show that it is in fact a Promise

```js
const soccerAnimation = animateBall(soccer);
console.log("soccerAnimation", soccerAnimation);
```

- [ ] Explain the Promise object:

  - [ ] represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its
        resulting value
  - [ ] has three `state`s: `"pending"` (waiting for the answer), `"resolved"` (sucess), and
        `"rejected"`(failure)
  - [ ] has a `then()` function (on the Prototype) that takes a callback function as an argument
        (Notice: we don't teach about Prototype inheritance. The students should just accept, that
        it is displayed like this in the console.)
  - [ ] while "waiting" for a Promise, other code can be executed

- [ ] Show that the `then()` function is called when the Promise is resolved:
  - [ ] call the `then()` method on the `soccerAnimation`
  - [ ] add a `console.log()` inside the `then()` callback
  - [ ] click the `Animate` button and show that the `console.log()` is called after the animation
        is finished
  - [ ] tell students to think of `then()` as a "when the Promise is resolved, then do this" event
        handler

```js
soccerAnimation.then(() => {
  console.log("soccer animation finished");
});
```

- [ ] Show how you can stagger the animations by executing the next animation in the `then()`
      function:

```js
soccerAnimation.then(() => {
  console.log("soccer animation finished");
  const basketballAnimation = animateBall(basketball);
});
```

- [ ] Show that this works for all four balls (feel free to copy and paste the code as this is very
      cumbersome to write by hand):

```js
const soccerAnimation = animateBall(soccer);
soccerAnimation
  .then(() => {
    console.log("soccer animation finished");
    const basketballAnimation = animateBall(basketball);
    return basketballAnimation;
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("basketball animation finished");
    const footballAnimation = animateBall(football);
    return footballAnimation;
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("football animation finished");
    const tennisAnimation = animateBall(tennis);
    return tennisAnimation;
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("tennis animation finished");
    animateButton.disabled = false;
  });
```

- [ ] Explain that the promises can be chained by returning the next promise from the callback function.
- [ ] Explain that this is a very cumbersome way to write code and that there is a better way to
      handle this.

#### Staggered Animations with `async/await`

- [ ] Explain that the `async/await` syntax is a way to write asynchronous code that looks like
      synchronous code and can untangle the "callback hell".

- [ ] Explain `async` and `await` keywords:

  - [ ] `async` marks a function as asynchronous
  - [ ] `await` "waits" (without blocking) for the following Promise to be resolved before the
        execution continues
  - [ ] `await` is syntactic sugar for `.then()`
  - [ ] Note that `await` can only be used **inside** an `async` function: Whenever we use `await`
        the enclosing function must be marked with `async`.

- [ ] Adapt the code to wait for each animation to finish:
  - [ ] Add the `async` keyword before the callback function.
  - [ ] Use the `await` keyword to wait for the `soccerAnimation` to finish.
  - [ ] Use `await` for the other animations as well and untangle the "callback hell".

```js
animateButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  animateButton.setAttribute("disabled", "disabled");

  const soccerAnimation = animateBall(soccer);
  await soccerAnimation;
  console.log("soccer animation finished");

  const basketballAnimation = animateBall(basketball);
  await basketballAnimation;
  console.log("basketball animation finished");

  const footballAnimation = animateBall(football);
  await footballAnimation;
  console.log("football animation finished");

  const tennisAnimation = animateBall(tennis);
  await tennisAnimation;
  console.log("tennis animation finished");

  animateButton.removeAttribute("disabled");
});
```

- [ ] Show that this also works without the indermediary variables (and the console.log()s):

```js
animateButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  animateButton.setAttribute("disabled", "disabled");

  await animateBall(soccer);
  await animateBall(basketball);
  await animateBall(football);
  await animateBall(tennis);

  animateButton.removeAttribute("disabled");
});
```

### Promises that resolve with a value

- [ ] Explain that a Promise can resolve with a value:
  - [ ] the `finished` property of the `Animation` object resolves with no value (`undefined`)
        because it is only used to know when the animation is finished
  - [ ] other APIs can resolve with a value, for example the `fetch()` API
  - [ ] explain that the `fetch()` API is used to make HTTP requests and that we will look into it
        in detail in the next session
  - [ ] for now it is enough to know that `fetch()` resolves with a `Response` object
  - [ ] the value can be accessed via the `then()` function
  - [ ] when using the `async/await` syntax, the `await` expression resolves to the value
- [ ] Use this demo by running this command in your Terminal:

  ```
  npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-async-functions/fetch-demo
  ```

- [ ] Explain the code:
  - [ ] the global `fetch()` function is used to make a HTTP request
  - [ ] the `fetch()` function returns a Promise that resolves with a `Response` object
  - [ ] the `Response` object is stored in the `response` variable
  - [ ] the `response` variable is logged to the console
- [ ] Show the `response` object logged to the console after clicking the "Fetch" button

- [ ] Explain that things can go wrong when you try to access external resources (e.g. server down, no internet)
- [ ] Explain that it's necessary to handle such errors gracefully
- [ ] Explain the concept of `try/catch`:
  - [ ] If fetch can't reach the server, it will "throw" an error
  - [ ] Our code has to "catch" this error, otherwise our program will stop working
  - [ ] Errors can be "caught" anywhere in the call stack
  - [ ] With the `async/await` syntax you can catch and handle errors with a `try/catch` block:
    ```js
    try {
      const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Emphasize that we have access to the actual error inside the `catch` block. We could examine it and take appropriate actions to inform the user.
  - [ ] Show that there is a similar mechanism for the `.then()` syntax:
    ```js
    fetch(apiUrl)
      .then((response) => {
        console.log("fetch succeeded!");
        console.log(response);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("fetch failed");
        console.log(error);
      });
    ```
  - [ ] You can provoke an error by changing the `apiUrl` to something unreachable, e.g. by changing the protocol from `https` to `htt` or something similar

### Examples of Asynchronous APIs (Or: Why do we need this again?)

- [ ] Summarize that some code is asynchronous and we have to wait for its return value.
- [ ] Name some asynchronous APIs:
  - [ ] `element.animate().finished` â€” animates an element and returns a Promise that resolves when
        the animation is complete (as seen in the demo above)
  - [ ] `fetch()` â€” makes an HTTP request and returns a Promise that resolves to a `Response` object
        (topic of future lession)
  - [ ] `navigator.getBattery()` â€” gets the current battery level and returns a Promise that
        resolves with the battery level (Chrome only at the time of writing)
  - [ ] later when working outside of the browser filesystem APIs and database APIs will be
        asynchronous as well

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](js-async-functions.md) and the
      [challenges](challenges-js-async-functions.md) to the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

Promise, async, await, single-threaded

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are

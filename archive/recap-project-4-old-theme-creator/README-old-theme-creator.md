# React Recap Project

## Theme Creator App

In this 4 day recap project, the students create a color theme creator app. The project is divided into [8 parts or user stories](https://github.com/wd-bootcamp/web-exercises/blob/main/sessions/recap-project-4/README.md).

## Session Guide

Hand out the challenges to the students, they will find a link to the [instructions](https://www.github.com/wd-bootcamp/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/reacap-project-4). The setup of the project is the following:

- Each student will work individually on the recap project.
- The students will start the project from scratch with `npx create-react-app`.
- In the first user stories, the students will use some [example theme data](https://github.com/wd-bootcamp/web-exercises/blob/main/sessions/recap-project-4/assets/db.js) to test their components.
- The students have not learned about styled components yet. You can advise them to use `BEM` for their css class names.
- The tasks for each user story offer some general advise how to implement each feature, but are not a step by step solution.
- Each part has 2-3 hints in a separate file to assist students when they are stuck.

The last 3 user stories can be more challenging for the students. You can remind them that they are optional and it is ok if they struggle.

There is an [example solution](https://github.com/neuefische-web-demos/theme-creator-example-solution/tree/main) with a branch for part-1 to part-8.

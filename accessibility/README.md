## Session Guide

> This is an active learning session, this means that the session should take up to 5-10 minutes. The session is meant as an introduction into the topic, most concepts will be learned independently by the students with the help of the active learning material.

Websites should be accessible to all people, independent of their physical conditions. Highlighting bad practices in web development that limit the useablity of the website is therefore important. Accessibility is also crucial for SEO (search engine optimization) and by this crucial for its performance.

> Which features and requirements need to be taken into account when developing a website such that everybody can access it with ease?

### Why should I care about accessibility?

- Explain web accessibility (short [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym)): `websites, tools and technologies that are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them`.
- Explain what disabilities affect interaction/access: `auditory`, `cognitive`, `neurological`, `physical`, `speech`, `visual`.
- Explain how accessibility `benefits all people`: different screen sizes, changing abilities due to aging, temporary disabilities, situational limitations, slow Internet connection.
- Show [this chart from Microsoft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5230863/180420356-992fb11b-8834-47b6-92a6-90ba59dbf93d.png) to explain how disabilities can be very situational.
- Explain that a11y is required by law in many situations (e.g. for [public sector bodies in the EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&from=de)).
- Explain that the web is an increasingly important resource (digital government offices, etc.).
- Explain that accessibility also improves `inclusivity`.
- Explain that it increases business potential (better job chances, better hiring chances for employers, SEO, etc.).
